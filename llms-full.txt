### Big data
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Data & Analytics

Big data refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many fields (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[3] The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Thus a fourth concept, veracity, refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data. Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, then the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization's capacity to create and capture value from big data.[4]

Current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. "There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem."[5] Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to "spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on".[6] Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet searches, fintech, healthcare analytics, geographic information systems, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics,[7] connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology, and environmental research.[8]

The size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices, cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices, aerial (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.[9][10] The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[11] as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5×260 bytes) of data are generated.[12] Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data.[13] According to IDC, global spending on big data and business analytics (BDA) solutions is estimated to reach $215.7 billion in 2021.[14][15] While Statista report, the global big data market is forecasted to grow to $103 billion by 2027.[16] In 2011 McKinsey & Company reported, if US healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality, the sector could create more than $300 billion in value every year.[17] In the developed economies of Europe, government administrators could save more than €100 billion ($149 billion) in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data.[17] And users of services enabled by personal-location data could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus.[17] One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.[18]

Relational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data. The processing and analysis of big data may require "massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers".[19] What qualifies as "big data" varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools. Furthermore, expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. "For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration."

### Blockchain
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.

A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need for a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.

Features
Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highligh  Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)

### Common Lisp
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

Common Lisp (CL) is a dialect of the Lisp programming language, published in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard document ANSI INCITS 226-1994 (S2018) (formerly X3.226-1994 (R1999)).[2] The Common Lisp HyperSpec, a hyperlinked HTML version, has been derived from the ANSI Common Lisp standard.

The Common Lisp language was developed as a standardized and improved successor of Maclisp. By the early 1980s several groups were already at work on diverse successors to MacLisp: Lisp Machine Lisp (aka ZetaLisp), Spice Lisp, NIL and S-1 Lisp. Common Lisp sought to unify, standardise, and extend the features of these MacLisp dialects. Common Lisp is not an implementation, but rather a language specification. Several implementations of the Common Lisp standard are available, including free and open-source software and proprietary products.[5] Common Lisp is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. It supports a combination of procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms. As a dynamic programming language, it facilitates evolutionary and incremental software development, with iterative compilation into efficient run-time programs. This incremental development is often done interactively without interrupting the running application.  Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp

### Computer vision
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** AI & Machine Learning

Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input to the retina in the human analog) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.

The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multi-dimensional data from a 3D scanner, 3D point clouds from LiDaR sensors, or medical scanning devices. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.

Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, activity recognition, video tracking, object recognition, 3D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, 3D scene modeling, and image restoration.

### Digital twins
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

A digital twin is a digital model of an intended or actual real-world physical product, system, or process (a physical twin) that serves as the effectively indistinguishable digital counterpart of it for practical purposes, such as simulation, integration, testing, monitoring, and maintenance. The digital twin is the underlying premise for Product Lifecycle Management and exists throughout the entire lifecycle of the physical entity it represents. Since information is detailed, the digital twin representation is determined by the value-based use cases it is created to implement. The digital twin can exist before the physical entity, as for example with virtual prototyping. The use of a digital twin in the creation phase allows the intended entity's entire lifecycle to be modeled and simulated. A digital twin of an existing entity may be used in real time and regularly synchronized with the corresponding physical system.  Ref:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin

### Distributed ledger
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

A distributed ledger (also called a shared ledger or distributed ledger technology or DLT) is the consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data that is geographically spread (distributed) across many sites, countries, or institutions. In contrast to a centralized database, a distributed ledger does not require a central administrator, and consequently does not have a single (central) point-of-failure.

In general, a distributed ledger requires a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network and consensus algorithms so that the ledger is reliably replicated across distributed computer nodes (servers, clients, etc.). The most common form of distributed ledger technology is the blockchain (commonly associated with the Bitcoin cryptocurrency), which can either be on a public or private network. Infrastructure for data management is a common barrier to implementing DLT.   Ref:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger

### DNS
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers, services, and other resources in the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It associates various information with domain names (identification strings) assigned to each of the associated entities. Most prominently, it translates readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.[1] The Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.

The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over subdomains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and fault-tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large central database. In addition, the DNS specifies the technical functionality of the database service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet protocol suite.

### Domain Driven Security
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Data & Analytics

We all know we have people like Anonymous, LulzSec, and NSA around. With this in mind, shouldn’t we start thinking about the security of our systems? Well, of course. But, could you turn your knowledge of DDD into an advantage for understanding and counteracting security vulnerabilities? Yes, you could. This session is about exactly that.

“Business” and “technical” attacks are two kinds of attacks, where the latter is the most famous, e g SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting. But this doesn’t mean business attacks are less harmful. On the contrary, attacks on the business tend to be extremely sophisticated and powerful as they often leave the infrastructure intact and trigger no alarms.

Domain Driven Security is the field that counteracts both types of attacks by using tools and mindsets from DDD in a clever way by whitelisting value ranges of the types.

### Domain-driven design (DDD)
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

Domain-driven design (DDD) is a major software design approach, focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.

Under domain-driven design, the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example: if software processes loan applications, it might have classes like "loan application", "customers", and methods such as "accept offer" and "withdraw".

Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:

placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;
basing complex designs on a model of the domain;
initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
Critics of domain-driven design argue that developers must typically implement a great deal of isolation and encapsulation to maintain the model as a pure and helpful construct. While domain-driven design provides benefits such as maintainability, Microsoft recommends it only for complex domains where the model provides clear benefits in formulating a common understanding of the domain.

The term was coined by Eric Evans in his book of the same title published in 2003.  Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a client–server architecture.

The technology eliminates the need for individually configuring network devices manually, and consists of two network components, a centrally installed network DHCP server and client instances of the protocol stack on each computer or device. When connected to the network, and periodically thereafter, a client requests a set of parameters from the server using DHCP.

DHCP can be implemented on networks ranging in size from residential networks to large campus networks and regional ISP networks.[2] Many routers and residential gateways have DHCP server capability. Most residential network routers receive a unique IP address within the ISP network. Within a local network, a DHCP server assigns a local IP address to each device.

DHCP services exist for networks running Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), as well as version 6 (IPv6). The IPv6 version of the DHCP protocol is commonly called DHCPv6.   ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol

Elasticsearch is a highly scalable, open-source full-text search and analytics engine based on Apache Lucene. Proficiency in Elasticsearch involves the ability to deploy, configure, and manage Elasticsearch clusters to store, search, and analyze large volumes of data in real-time. This skill is essential for building efficient search functionalities, log analysis, and big data analytics applications.

A key aspect of working with Elasticsearch is understanding its core concepts such as indices, documents, shards, and replicas. Skilled users can design optimal index mappings and settings to suit specific data models and search requirements. This includes defining appropriate data types, analyzers, tokenizers, and filters to enable advanced text analysis and querying capabilities.

Expertise in Elasticsearch also encompasses the ability to construct complex search queries using the Elasticsearch Query DSL (Domain Specific Language). This involves performing full-text searches, aggregations, filtering, and sorting to extract meaningful insights from the data. Knowledge of performance optimization techniques—such as tuning cluster configurations, managing resources, and scaling clusters—is crucial for maintaining efficient and reliable search operations.

Advanced Elasticsearch skills may include integrating Elasticsearch with other components of the Elastic Stack, such as Logstash for data ingestion and Kibana for data visualization. Understanding security features like role-based access control, TLS encryption, and secure communication is important for deploying Elasticsearch in production environments.

### Embedded system
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

An embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system.[1][2] It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints. Embedded systems control many devices in common use.[3] In 2009, it was estimated that ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured were used in embedded systems.[4][needs update]

Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).   Ref:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system

### Extreme programming (XP)
**Type:** Knowledge-Based | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent releases in short development cycles, intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.

Other elements of extreme programming include programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, not programming features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, code simplicity and clarity, expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers. The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to "extreme" levels. As an example, code reviews are considered a beneficial practice; taken to the extreme, code can be reviewed continuously (i.e. the practice of pair programming).

### Hazelcast
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Data & Analytics

Hazelcast is a distributed computation and storage platform for consistently low-latency querying, aggregation and stateful computation against event streams and traditional data sources. It allows you to quickly build resource-efficient, real-time applications. You can deploy it at any scale from small edge devices to a large cluster of cloud instances.

Hazelcast can process data on a set of networked and clustered computers that pool together their random access memories (RAM) to let applications share data with other applications running in the cluster. When data is stored in RAM, applications run a lot faster since it does not need to be retrieved from disk and put into RAM prior to processing. Using Hazelcast, you can store and process your data in RAM, spread and replicate it across a cluster of machines; replication gives you resilience to failures of cluster members.

Hazelcast is implemented in Java language and has clients for Java, C++, .NET, REST, Python, Go and Node.js. Hazelcast also speaks Memcached and REST protocols.

Your cloud-native applications can easily use Hazelcast. It is flexible enough to use as a data and computing platform out-of-the-box or as a framework for your own cloud-native applications and microservices.

Hazelcast is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Since it is delivered as a compact library, it easily plugs into your software solution.

It is designed to scale up to hundreds of members and thousands of clients. When you add new members, they automatically discover the cluster and linearly increase both the memory and processing capacity. The members maintain a TCP connection between each other and all communication is performed through this layer. Each cluster member is configured to be the same in terms of functionality. The oldest member (the first member created in the cluster) automatically performs the stored and streaming data assignment to cluster members. If the oldest member dies, the second oldest member takes over.

Hazelcast offers simple scalability, partitioning (sharding), and re-balancing out-of-the-box. It does not require any extra coordination processes. NoSQL and traditional databases are difficult to scale out and manage. They require additional processes for coordination and high availability. With Hazelcast, when you start another process to add more capacity, data and backups are automatically and evenly balanced.

### HTTP/2
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

HTTP/2 (originally named HTTP/2.0) is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web. It was derived from the earlier experimental SPDY protocol, originally developed by Google. HTTP/2 was developed by the HTTP Working Group (also called httpbis, where "bis" means "twice") of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). HTTP/2 is the first new version of HTTP since HTTP/1.1, which was standardized in RFC 2068 in 1997. The Working Group presented HTTP/2 to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for consideration as a Proposed Standard in December 2014,[6][7] and IESG approved it to publish as Proposed Standard on February 17, 2015 (and was updated in February 2020 in regard to TLS 1.3 and again in June 2022). The initial HTTP/2 specification was published as RFC 7540 on May 14, 2015.[10]

The standardization effort was supported by Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, Safari, Amazon Silk, and Edge browsers. Most major browsers had added HTTP/2 support by the end of 2015. About 97% of web browsers used have the capability (and 100% of "tracked desktop" web browsers).[13] As of July 2023, 36% (after topping out at just over 50%) of the top 10 million websites support HTTP/2.

Its successor is HTTP/3, a major revision that builds on the concepts established by HTTP/2.   Ref:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2

### HTTP/3
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

HTTP/3 is the third major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used to exchange information on the World Wide Web, complementing the widely-deployed HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. Unlike previous versions which relied on the well-established TCP (published in 1974), HTTP/3 uses QUIC, a multiplexed transport protocol built on UDP. On 6 June 2022, IETF published HTTP/3 as a Proposed Standard in RFC 9114.

HTTP/3 uses similar semantics compared to earlier revisions of the protocol, including the same request methods, status codes, and message fields, but encodes them and maintains session state differently. However, partially due to the protocol's adoption of QUIC, HTTP/3 has lower latency and loads more quickly in real-world usage when compared with previous versions: in some cases over four times as fast than with HTTP/1.1 (which, for many websites, is the only HTTP version deployed).

As of April 2024, HTTP/3 is at least partially supported by 97% of all web browser installations and 98% of mobile web browser installations tracked by "Can I Use", a website that tracks and provides information on web technologies compatibility with different web browsers. HTTP/3 is supported by 29% of the top 10 million websites. It has been supported by Chromium (and derived projects including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Samsung Internet, and Opera) since April 2020 and by Mozilla Firefox since May 2021. Safari 14 implemented the protocol but it remains disabled by default.  Ref:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3

As shown in the below diagram, Classloaders are in charge of loading classes from binary to in-memory. When you run the compiled HelloWorld application (HelloWorld.class), the agent could be viewed as a way to intercept classloaders behavior at runtime. You may think how come the java byte code will be restructured so that agent can add the relevant code at the correct places. The interesting fact is, for Java programs, the structure of the bytecode is really close to the original Java program source code. Hence, while we don’t instrument the Java program itself, we use a very close representation of it. One thing to note is that there are non-Java languages that compile into Java bytecode (such as Scala, Clojure, and Kotlin), which means that the structure and shape of the bytecode for programs can be very different.

### Logistics
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

Logistics is the part of supply chain management that deals with the efficient forward and reverse flow of goods, services, and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption according to the needs of customers. Logistics management is a component that holds the supply chain together. The resources managed in logistics may include tangible goods such as materials, equipment, and supplies, as well as food and other consumable items.

In military logistics, it is concerned with maintaining army supply lines with food, armaments, ammunition, and spare parts apart from the transportation of troops themselves. Meanwhile, civil logistics deals with acquiring, moving, and storing raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods. For organisations that provide garbage collection, mail deliveries, public utilities, and after-sales services, logistical problems must be addressed.

Logistics deals with the movements of materials or products from one facility to another; it does not include material flow within the production or assembly plants, such as production planning or single-machine scheduling.[2] Logistics occupies a significant amount of the operational cost of an organisation or country. Logistical costs of organizations in the United States incurred about 11% of United States national gross domestic product (GDP) as of 1997. In the European Union, logistics costs were 8.8% to 11.5% of GDP as of 1993.

Dedicated simulation software can model, analyze, visualize, and optimize logistics' complexity. Minimizing resource use is a common motivation in all logistics fields. A professional working in logistics management is called a logistician.  Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics

### Low-code development platform
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

A low-code development platform (LCDP) provides a development environment used to create application software, generally through a graphical user interface (as opposed to only writing code, though some coding is possible and may be required). A low-coded platform may produce entirely operational applications, or require additional coding for specific situations. Low-code development platforms are typically on a high abstraction level, and can reduce the amount of traditional time spent, enabling accelerated delivery of business applications. A common benefit is that a wider range of people can contribute to the application's development, not only those with coding skills, but good governance is needed to be able to adhere to common rules and regulations. LCDPs can also lower the initial cost of setup, training, deployment, and maintenance.

Low-code development platforms trace their roots back to fourth-generation programming language and the rapid application development tools of the 1990s and early 2000s. Similar to these predecessor development environments, LCDPs are based on the principles of model-driven architecture, automatic code generation, and visual programming. The concept of end-user development also existed previously, although LCDPs brought some new ways of approaching this development. The low-code development platform market traces its origins back to 2011. The specific name "low-code" was not put forward until 9 June, 2014, when it was used by the industry analyst Forrester Research. Along with no-code development platforms, low-code was described as "extraordinarily disruptive" in Forbes magazine in 2017.    Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform

### MCP Model Context Protocol
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** AI & Machine Learning

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a sophisticated communication framework designed to standardize and optimize the interaction between AI models and context providers. This protocol addresses the fundamental challenge of efficiently supplying AI systems with rich, structured contextual information needed for more accurate, relevant, and personalized responses.
Core Principles
The Model Context Protocol is built on several key principles:
Bidirectional Communication: Unlike traditional one-way input systems, MCP establishes a two-way communication channel between AI models and context providers, allowing for dynamic context discovery and refinement during processing.
Context Separation: MCP clearly separates context information from user queries, enabling more precise context management and preventing context collapse in complex applications.
Structured Metadata: The protocol enforces a consistent schema for metadata that describes the nature, source, reliability, and temporal aspects of contextual information.
Progressive Enhancement: Context can be delivered in layers of increasing specificity, allowing models to request additional details only when needed.
Transactional Context: MCP supports context sessions that persist across multiple interactions, maintaining state while allowing for explicit context switching.

Practical Applications
MCP is particularly valuable in these scenarios:
Enterprise AI Systems: Where models need access to organizational knowledge, permissions, and business logic.
Multi-Modal AI: Systems processing various input types (text, images, voice) that require unified context management.
Autonomous Systems: Robots or vehicles that must maintain situational awareness across various sensors and information sources.
Personal AI Assistants: Applications that personalize responses based on user profiles, preferences, and interaction history.
Development Environments: IDEs and coding assistants that need to understand project structure, coding standards, and build environments.

### microservice architecture
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

A microservice architecture – a variant of the SOA (service-oriented architecture) structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservice architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The goal is that teams can bring their services to life independent of others. Loose coupling reduces all types of dependencies and the complexities around it, as service developers do not need to care about the users of the service, they do not force their changes onto users of the service.[1][clarification needed] Therefore it allows organizations developing software to grow fast and big, as well as use off-the-shelf services more easily. Communication requirements are reduced. These benefits come at a cost to maintaining the decoupling. Interfaces need to be designed carefully and treated as a public API.

**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

Azure is Microsoft's public cloud platform. Azure offers a large collection of services, which includes platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and managed database service capabilities. However, what exactly is Azure, and how does it work?

Azure, like other cloud platforms, relies on a technology known as virtualization. Most computer hardware can be emulated in software. Computer hardware is simply a set of instructions, which are permanently, or semi-permanently, encoded in silicon. Emulation layers are used to map software instructions to hardware instructions. Emulation layers allow virtualized hardware to execute in software like the actual hardware itself.

Essentially, the cloud is a set of physical servers in one or more datacenters. The datacenters execute virtualized hardware for customers. So how does the cloud create, start, stop, and delete millions of instances of virtualized hardware for millions of customers simultaneously?

To understand the servers, let's look at the architecture of hardware in the datacenter. Inside each datacenter, there's a collection of servers sitting in server racks. Each server rack contains many server blades, and a network switch. These provide network connectivity and a power distribution unit (PDU), which creates power. Racks are sometimes grouped together in larger units known as clusters.

The server racks, or clusters, are chosen to run virtualized hardware instances for the user. However, some servers run cloud management software, known as a fabric controller. The fabric controller is a distributed application with many responsibilities. It allocates services, monitors the health of the server and the services running on it, and heals servers when they fail.

Each instance of the fabric controller is connected to another set of servers running cloud orchestration software, typically known as the front end. The front end hosts the web services, RESTful APIs, and internal Azure databases, which are used for all functions in the cloud.

For example, the front end hosts the services that handle customer requests. The requests allocate Azure resources and services such as virtual machines, and Azure Cosmos DB. First, the front end validates and verifies if the user is authorized to allocate the requested resources. If so, the front end checks a database to locate a server rack with sufficient capacity, which instructs the fabric controller to allocate the resource.

Azure is a huge collection of servers and networking hardware, which runs a complex set of distributed applications. These applications orchestrate the configuration and operation of virtualized hardware and software on those servers. The orchestration of these servers is what makes Azure so powerful. With Azure, users don't have to maintain and upgrade their hardware as Azure does this behind the scenes.

Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.

Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).

The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation.

### OpenEJB
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

OpenEJB was founded by Richard Monson-Haefel and David Blevins in December 1999. At the time there were new vendors moving in the enterprise Java space seemingly every week. Rather than join the space as a competitor, the project was focused entirely on providing these new platforms with a way to quickly get EJB compliance via plugging OpenEJB into their application server.

The first to integrate OpenEJB in this fashion was Apple's WebObjects in late 2000, released in 2001. When the project moved to Source Forge in 2002 an Apache Tomcat integration was created. Again rather than follow what most in the industry were doing and putting Tomcat into OpenEJB, the project decided to follow its vision and provide an integration that allowed Tomcat users to plug in OpenEJB to gain EJB support in the Tomcat platform. It was in this same vein of putting an EJB container into a Web server that the project developed the Collapsed EAR concept of putting EJBs inside the .war file.

As part of the work that OpenEJB did to prepare for the integration with Apple's WebObjects, a very large integration test suite was developed. The test suite was developed as a generic application since it would need to be run against both WebObjects and other platforms that integrated OpenEJB. For simplicity in the build the test suite based on JUnit, was run with OpenEJB right inside the tests rather than as a separate process, which was easy to do as the container was designed to be plugged into other platforms and make as little assumptions about its environment as possible. It was from this work that the concept of combining an EJB application with plain unit tests and an embeddable EJB container was born. Originally referred to as a "local" EJB container and what lead the project to describe itself as being able to run in two modes: Local and Remote.

In August 2003 the project helped launch the Apache Geronimo application server. Originally a new version of OpenEJB was developed ground up based on Geronimo's GBean architecture and released as OpenEJB 2.0 which lived throughout the Geronimo 1.x cycle. In 2006 when EJB 3.0 was released which had a focus on simplicity, the project went back to its roots and revived the OpenEJB 1.0 codebase, ported select bits of the 2.0 codebase, and eventually brought it up to the EJB 3.0 spec level in what is now called OpenEJB 3.0.

### Pentesting -  penetration testing
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

A penetration test, colloquially known as a pentest, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system; this is not to be confused with a vulnerability assessment. The test is performed to identify weaknesses (or vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

The process typically identifies the target systems and a particular goal, then reviews available information and undertakes various means to attain that goal. A penetration test target may be a white box (about which background and system information are provided in advance to the tester) or a black box (about which only basic information other than the company name is provided). A gray box penetration test is a combination of the two (where limited knowledge of the target is shared with the auditor). A penetration test can help identify a system's vulnerabilities to attack and estimate how vulnerable it is.

Security issues that the penetration test uncovers should be reported to the system owner. Penetration test reports may also assess potential impacts to the organization and suggest countermeasures to reduce the risk. Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test

### protocol design
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

A communication protocol is a system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both.[1]

Communicating systems use well-defined formats for exchanging various messages. Each message has an exact meaning intended to elicit a response from a range of possible responses pre-determined for that particular situation. The specified behavior is typically independent of how it is to be implemented. Communication protocols have to be agreed upon by the parties involved. To reach an agreement, a protocol may be developed into a technical standard. A programming language describes the same for computations, so there is a close analogy between protocols and programming languages: protocols are to communication what programming languages are to computations. An alternate formulation states that protocols are to communication what algorithms are to computation.

Composite oriented programming (COP) addresses one of the short comings of OO: That the meaning of an object depends on the context.

In most OO languages today, it’s hard to change the type of an object. Actually, Object Oriented Programming should be called Class Oriented Programming because the class (the type) is the core feature which we use to build application.

But in the real world, objects can have several types. This isn’t polymorphism. It means that COP allows you use the data in an instance within the context of several classes.

### Quantum computing
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Security & Cybersecurity

A quantum computer is a computer that takes advantage of quantum mechanical phenomena.

On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior, specifically quantum superposition and entanglement, using specialized hardware that supports the preparation and manipulation of quantum states.

Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster (with respect to input size scaling) than any modern "classical" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the technology is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications. Moreover, scalable quantum computers do not hold promise for many practical tasks, and for many important tasks quantum speedups are proven impossible.

### QUIC
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

QUIC (/kwɪk/) is a general-purpose transport layer network protocol initially designed by Jim Roskind at Google,[3] implemented, and deployed in 2012, announced publicly in 2013 as experimentation broadened, and described at an IETF meeting. QUIC is used by more than half of all connections from the Chrome web browser to Google's servers.[9] Microsoft Edge (which, after version 1, is a derivative of the open-source Chromium browser), Firefox, and Safari support it.

Although its name was initially proposed as the acronym for "Quick UDP Internet Connections", IETF's use of the word QUIC is not an acronym; it is simply the name of the protocol. QUIC improves performance of connection-oriented web applications that are currently using TCP. It does this by establishing a number of multiplexed connections between two endpoints using User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and is designed to obsolete TCP at the transport layer for many applications, thus earning the protocol the occasional nickname "TCP/2".

### Real-time computing
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

Real-time computing (RTC) is the computer science term for hardware and software systems subject to a "real-time constraint", for example from event to system response.[1] Real-time programs must guarantee response within specified time constraints, often referred to as "deadlines".[2]

The term "real-time" is also used in simulation to mean that the simulation's clock runs at the same speed as a real clock.

Real-time responses are often understood to be in the order of milliseconds, and sometimes microseconds. A system not specified as operating in real time cannot usually guarantee a response within any timeframe, although typical or expected response times may be given. Real-time processing fails if not completed within a specified deadline relative to an event; deadlines must always be met, regardless of system load.

A real-time system has been described as one which "controls an environment by receiving data, processing them, and returning the results sufficiently quickly to affect the environment at that time".[3] The term "real-time" is used in process control and enterprise systems to mean "without significant delay".

Real-time software may use one or more of the following: synchronous programming languages, real-time operating systems (RTOSes), and real-time networks, each of which provide essential frameworks on which to build a real-time software application.

It takes the guesswork out of staying current with security updates to open-source packages as they're released. For many years, Dependabot has been the standard tool for this practice, but Renovate has become the preferred tool for many of our teams. They find that Renovate is more suitable to the modern software development environment where a deployable system relies not just on code and libraries but encompasses run-time tools, infrastructure and third-party services. Renovate covers dependencies on these ancillary artifacts in addition to code. Our teams also found that Renovate offers more flexibility through configuration and customization options. Although Dependabot remains a safe default choice and is conveniently integrated with GitHub, we'd recommend evaluating Renovate to see if it can further reduce the manual burden on developers to keep their application ecosystems safe and secure.

RAG is an AI framework for retrieving facts from an external knowledge base to ground large language models (LLMs) on the most accurate, up-to-date information and to give users insight into LLMs' generative process.

Large language models can be inconsistent. Sometimes they nail the answer to questions, other times they regurgitate random facts from their training data. If they occasionally sound like they have no idea what they’re saying, it’s because they don’t. LLMs know how words relate statistically, but not what they mean.

### Routing
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks. Broadly, routing is performed in many types of networks, including circuit-switched networks, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), and computer networks, such as the Internet.

In packet switching networks, routing is the higher-level decision making that directs network packets from their source toward their destination through intermediate network nodes by specific packet forwarding mechanisms. Packet forwarding is the transit of network packets from one network interface to another. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as routers, gateways, firewalls, or switches. General-purpose computers also forward packets and perform routing, although they have no specially optimized hardware for the task.

The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of routing tables. Routing tables maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Routing tables may be specified by an administrator, learned by observing network traffic or built with the assistance of routing protocols.

### Secure Coding
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

Secure coding is the practice of developing computer software in such a way that guards against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities. Defects, bugs and logic flaws are consistently the primary cause of commonly exploited software vulnerabilities. Through the analysis of thousands of reported vulnerabilities, security professionals have discovered that most vulnerabilities stem from a relatively small number of common software programming errors. By identifying the insecure coding practices that lead to these errors and educating developers on secure alternatives, organizations can take proactive steps to help significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in software before deployment.

Some scholars have suggested that in order to effectively confront threats related to cybersecurity, proper security should be coded or “baked in” to the systems. With security being designed into the software, this ensures that there will be protection against insider attacks and reduces the threat to application security.

### Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Security & Cybersecurity

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. Mail servers and other message transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages. User-level email clients typically use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying, and typically submit outgoing email to the mail server on port 587 or 465 per RFC 8314. For retrieving messages, IMAP (which replaced the older POP3) is standard, but proprietary servers also often implement proprietary protocols, e.g., Exchange ActiveSync.

SMTP's origins began in 1980, building on concepts implemented on the ARPANET since 1971. It has been updated, modified and extended multiple times. The protocol version in common use today has extensible structure with various extensions for authentication, encryption, binary data transfer, and internationalized email addresses. SMTP servers commonly use the Transmission Control Protocol on port number 25 (for plaintext) and 587 (for encrypted communications).

### Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** DevOps & Platform Engineering

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior. Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems, routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and more.

SNMP is widely used in network management for network monitoring. SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems organized in a management information base (MIB), which describes the system status and configuration. These variables can then be remotely queried (and, in some circumstances, manipulated) by managing applications.

Three significant versions of SNMP have been developed and deployed. SNMPv1 is the original version of the protocol. More recent versions, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, feature improvements in performance, flexibility and security.

SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an application layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.  Ref:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol

### Single sign-on (SSO)
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Security & Cybersecurity

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.

True single sign-on allows the user to log in once and access services without re-entering authentication factors.

It should not be confused with same-sign on (Directory Server Authentication), often accomplished by using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and stored LDAP databases on (directory) servers.[1][2]

A simple version of single sign-on can be achieved over IP networks using cookies but only if the sites share a common DNS parent domain.[3]

For clarity, a distinction is made between Directory Server Authentication (same-sign on) and single sign-on: Directory Server Authentication refers to systems requiring authentication for each application but using the same credentials from a directory server, whereas single sign-on refers to systems where a single authentication provides access to multiple applications by passing the authentication token seamlessly to configured applications.

Conversely, single sign-off or single log-out (SLO) is the property whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to multiple software systems.

As different applications and resources support different authentication mechanisms, single sign-on must internally store the credentials used for initial authentication and translate them to the credentials required for the different mechanisms.

Other shared authentication schemes, such as OpenID and OpenID Connect, offer other services that may require users to make choices during a sign-on to a resource, but can be configured for single sign-on if those other services (such as user consent) are disabled.[4] An increasing number of federated social logons, like Facebook Connect, do require the user to enter consent choices upon first registration with a new resource, and so are not always single sign-on in the strictest sense.

### Smalltalk
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

Smalltalk is a purely object oriented programming language (OOP) that was originally created in the 1970s for educational use, specifically for constructionist learning, but later found use in business. It was created at Xerox PARC by Learning Research Group (LRG) scientists, including Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Diana Merry, and Scott Wallace.

In Smalltalk, executing programs are built of opaque, atomic, so-called objects, which are instances of template code stored in classes. These objects intercommunicate by passing of messages, via an intermediary virtual machine environment (VM). A relatively small number of objects, called primitives, are not amenable to live redefinition, sometimes being defined independently of the Smalltalk programming environment.  Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk

### Smart contract
**Type:** Knowledge-Based | **Areas:** Process | **Domain:** Software Development

A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need for trusted intermediators, arbitration costs, and fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions. Smart contracts are commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, and the smart contracts introduced by Ethereum are generally considered a fundamental building block for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications.

The original Ethereum white paper by Vitalik Buterin in 2014 describes the Bitcoin protocol as a weak version of the smart contract concept as originally defined by Nick Szabo, and proposed a stronger version based on the Solidity language, which is Turing complete. Since Bitcoin,[clarification needed] various cryptocurrencies have supported programming languages which allow for more advanced smart contracts between untrusted parties.

### SOA
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

In software engineering, service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that focuses on discrete services instead of a monolithic design.[1] By consequence, it is as well applied in the field of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online. SOA is also intended to be independent of vendors, products and technologies.[2]

Service orientation is a way of thinking in terms of services and service-based development and the outcomes of services.[1]

A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:[3]

    It logically represents a repeatable business activity with a specified outcome.
    It is self-contained.
    It is a black box for its consumers, meaning the consumer does not have to be aware of the service's inner workings.
    It may be composed of other services.[4]

Different services can be used in conjunction as a service mesh to provide the functionality of a large software application,[5] a principle SOA shares with modular programming. Service-oriented architecture integrates distributed, separately maintained and deployed software components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that facilitate components' communication and cooperation over a network, especially over an IP network.

SOA is related to the idea of an API (application programming interface), an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software. An API can be thought of as the service, and the SOA the architecture that allows the service to operate.

### Social Coding
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Process | **Domain:** Software Development

Social coding empowers knowledge exchange. Software engineers have ideas all day long. Through social coding, they can discover and reuse code or solutions that they might otherwise unnecessarily duplicate. With social coding, you can discover, share, and implement new ideas with friends, and even with strangers!

Social coding can also increase the quality of your software. All developers can see and comment on the code changes. When you know that your code is going to be viewed by a wide audience, you have an added incentive to get it right. As the size of the audience increases, so does the likelihood that someone in the group knows the answer to a problem.

Not only can you learn from social coding, but it can be fun. Social coding fosters a fun work environment, encourages peer recognition, and promotes meritocracy, all of which are important to the DevOps culture.

### Structured output from LLMs
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** AI & Machine Learning

Structured output from LLMs refers to the practice of constraining a language model's response into a defined schema. This can be achieved either through instructing a generalized model to respond in a particular format or by fine-tuning a model so it "natively" outputs, for example, JSON. OpenAI now supports structured output, allowing developers to supply a JSON Schema, pydantic or Zod object to constrain model responses. This capability is particularly valuable for enabling function calling, API interactions and external integrations, where accuracy and adherence to a format are critical. Structured output not only enhances the way LLMs can interface with code but also supports broader use cases like generating markup for rendering charts. Additionally, structured output has been shown to reduce the chance of hallucinations within model output.  Ref:  https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/summary/structured-output-from-llms

### Systems engineering
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design, integrate, and manage complex systems over their life cycles. At its core, systems engineering utilizes systems thinking principles to organize this body of knowledge. The individual outcome of such efforts, an engineered system, can be defined as a combination of components that work in synergy to collectively perform a useful function.

Issues such as requirements engineering, reliability, logistics, coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability, and many other disciplines necessary for successful system design, development, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work processes, optimization methods, and risk management tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as industrial engineering, production systems engineering, process systems engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, production engineering, control engineering, software engineering, electrical engineering, cybernetics, aerospace engineering, organizational studies, civil engineering and project management. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered and integrated into a whole.

The systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high-quality outputs with minimum cost and time. The systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved and identifying the most probable or highest-impact failures that can occur. Systems engineering involves finding solutions to these problems.  Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering

**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.[1]
The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design. It was developed at Rational Software in 1994–1995, with further development led by them through 1996.

In 1997, UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005, UML was also published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard. Since then the standard has been periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML. In software engineering, most practitioners do not use UML, but instead produce informal hand drawn diagrams; these diagrams, however, often include elements from UML.

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

In computer networking, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core communication protocols of the Internet protocol suite used to send messages (transported as datagrams in packets) to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Within an IP network, UDP does not require prior communication to set up communication channels or data paths.

UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an application may instead use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.

UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system.

The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768.  Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol

### Procurement
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Process | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

Procurement is the process of locating and agreeing to terms and purchasing goods, services, or other works from an external source, often with the use of a tendering or competitive bidding process. The term may also refer to a contractual obligation to "procure", i.e. to "ensure" that something is done. When a government agency buys goods or services through this practice, it is referred to as government procurement or public procurement.

Procurement as an organizational process is intended to ensure that the buyer receives goods, services, or works at the best possible price when aspects such as quality, quantity, time, and location are compared. Corporations and public bodies often define processes intended to promote fair and open competition for their business while minimizing risks such as exposure to fraud and collusion.

Almost all purchasing decisions include factors such as delivery and handling, marginal benefit, and fluctuations in the prices of goods. Organisations which have adopted a corporate social responsibility perspective are also likely to require their purchasing activity to take wider societal and ethical considerations into account. On the other hand, the introduction of external regulations concerning accounting practices can affect ongoing buyer-supplier relations in unforeseen manners.

The program manager may be well-placed to provide this insight by actively seeking out such information from the project managers, although in large and/or complex projects, a specific role may be required. However this insight arises, the program manager needs this in order to be comfortable that the overall program goals are achievable.

### Supply chain management
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Process | **Domain:** DevOps & Platform Engineering

In commerce, supply chain management (SCM) deals with a system of procurement (purchasing raw materials/components), operations management, logistics and marketing channels, through which raw materials can be developed into finished products and delivered to their end customers. A more narrow definition of supply chain management is the "design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronising supply with demand and measuring performance globally". This can include the movement and storage of raw materials, work-in-process inventory, finished goods, and end to end order fulfilment from the point of origin to the point of consumption. Interconnected, interrelated or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain.

SCM is the broad range of activities required to plan, control and execute a product's flow from materials to production to distribution in the most economical way possible. SCM encompasses the integrated planning and execution of processes required to optimize the flow of materials, information and capital in functions that broadly include demand planning, sourcing, production, inventory management and logistics—or storage and transportation.

Supply chain management strives for an integrated, multidisciplinary, multimethod approach. Current [when?] research in supply chain management is concerned with topics related to resilience, sustainability, and risk management, among others. Some suggest that the "people dimension" of SCM, ethical issues, internal integration, transparency/visibility, and human capital/talent management are topics that have, so far, been underrepresented on the research agenda.

### Value-Based Negotiation Strategies
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical, Experience, Process | **Domain:** Software Development

Value-Based Negotiation Strategies is a critical skill in modern business and sales execution, emphasizing the creation and communication of value over mere price concessions during negotiations. Unlike traditional negotiation tactics that often focus on win-lose outcomes or simple price haggling, value-based negotiation centers on understanding and aligning with the unique needs, priorities, and pain points of both the buyer and the seller. Practitioners of this skill leverage deep product knowledge, industry insights, and consultative selling techniques to uncover what is most valuable to the client—such as ROI, risk reduction, innovation, or long-term partnership—and structure deals that maximize mutual benefit. This approach fosters trust, strengthens client relationships, and often leads to higher deal sizes, improved margins, and increased customer loyalty. In today’s competitive and rapidly changing business environment, value-based negotiation is especially relevant as buyers are more informed and expect tailored solutions rather than generic offerings. Typical use cases include complex B2B sales, enterprise software agreements, and strategic partnerships where differentiating on value is essential. Mastery of this skill requires active listening, empathy, creative problem-solving, and the ability to articulate and quantify value propositions clearly. By focusing on value creation rather than price, sales professionals can achieve sustainable, win-win outcomes that drive long-term business success.

### Value-Based Selling
**Type:** Knowledge-Based | **Areas:** Organizational, Process | **Domain:** Software Development

Value-Based Selling is a consultative sales approach that prioritizes understanding and aligning with the unique needs, challenges, and goals of each customer to deliver tailored solutions that maximize perceived value. Unlike traditional product- or feature-focused sales methods, value-based selling requires sales professionals to deeply engage with clients, uncover their business drivers, and articulate how their offerings directly address those drivers to create measurable business outcomes. This approach is especially relevant in today's competitive and complex business environment, where customers are increasingly discerning and expect clear, quantifiable returns on their investments. Practitioners of value-based selling employ active listening, needs analysis, and solution mapping to demonstrate the tangible and intangible benefits of their products or services, often using case studies, ROI calculations, and customer success stories. The skill is critical for building trust, differentiating offerings in crowded markets, increasing deal size, and fostering long-term customer loyalty. It is widely applied in B2B sales, enterprise solutions, SaaS, and consultative selling environments, where understanding the customer's business context and delivering tailored value propositions are essential for success. Mastery of value-based selling leads to stronger client relationships, higher win rates, and greater customer satisfaction, making it a cornerstone skill for modern sales professionals and organizations seeking sustainable growth.

### Vendor Management Strategies
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Organizational, Process | **Domain:** AI & Machine Learning

The following strategies enable an approach to working with partners:

    Collaborate closely with the actual people you procure for. Very often the team that requires a product or service to be procured for them will have a very good understanding of good options, and sometimes the best option, available. Listen to them, trust them, and better yet explicitly involve them up-front in the procurement process.
    Work with the right vendors. Many organizations make the mistake of working with a limited number of vendors, often to simplify procurement. But, if you want the best fit, then you really need to work with a range of vendors. Larger companies tend to offer commodity services and products and are often willing to work with you to gain the specific expertise they are currently missing (this is called “learning on your dime”). Smaller companies are more leading edge but may not have the capacity for larger service engagements or large product orders. Independent contractors are often experts in a specific topic, providing the expert advice or service you require but not at the scale that you may need. 
    Build partnerships. When it comes to procured services, vendor staff will often be a critical part of your value stream. So treat them as such and embed them as closely as you can. Ideally, the integration of full-time employees (FTEs) and contractors should be so good that it’s impossible to identify which company directly employs a given person on a team. Note that some countries, particularly the US, have specific laws that limit how you are able to treat contractors and consultants and may even put an upper limit on how long they may work for you. With respect to purchased products, you may choose to co-develop and even co-produce the offerings with one or more partner firms, sharing the resulting risks and revenues of doing so.

The following strategies lead to more effective contracting: 

    Prefer context-sensitive contracts. The point is that a multimillion-dollar services contract will be a bit more detailed than a contract for two-day workshop. A contract for Agile services should reflect how an agile team works whereas a contract for traditional services should reflect how a traditional team works. Use the right contract for what you are trying to procure – Context counts.
    Beware the extremes. When it comes to comparing vendors based on cost, which is a questionable strategy at best, our advice is that the vendors in the middle are often your best option. Our experience is that lowest bidder will likely produce low quality or will nickle-and-dime you via their change management strategy whereas the highest bidder either doesn’t want your business to begin with, aren’t streamlined in the way that they work and are thus higher cost, or in some cases really are the very best and know what they’re worth.
    Prefer flexible funding contracts over fixed-bid contracts. Fixed-bid tends to focus on initial price, thus promoting a lowest-bid mindset which leads to trouble. Systems thinking tells us to end the practice of awarding business based on price tag and instead minimize the total cost (or better yet maximize the net value received). Fixed price contracts tend to be a worst case scenario for all parties involved.
    Prefer incremental delivery contracts over big-bang contracts. The larger the contract, the greater the risk. To remove that risk, when it's possible, organize a large contract into small incremental deliverables. You reduce the cost of delay by doing so, introduce opportunities for learning and adjusting your strategy, and increase overall transparency (hence improving your ability to govern the contract).
    Prefer outcome-based contracts over feature-based contracts. Just like your internal metrics should be outcome-focused so should your contracts. There is no guarantee that the features you defined up front will be what customers want, an unfortunate outcome of the traditional “big requirements up front (BRUF)﻿

” strategy. Instead define contracts in terms of outcomes – increased sales, increased customer retention, customer growth, and so on. Effective contracts define a set of outcomes to achieve, a set of constraints, and give the team the freedom to work within that sandbox.
Avoid detailed contractual processes. Large amounts of up-front planning tend to increase risk in complex situations. Worse yet, detailed contractual processes tend to favor incumbents and large service providers (as opposed to the right vendors), they inhibit transparency (rarely exploring the implications of how a vendor will provide a service), they are inaccurate (everyone tends to be overly optimistic), and they usually ignore outcomes in favor of outputs.
Monitor fulfillment of contracts. Past performance is critical input into determining whether to award new work to a vendor, which is a significant motivator to act as a good partner right now. Just like regular retrospectives to identify potential improvements works well for solution delivery teams, the same technique can be applied to identify how well a contract is being fulfilled and more importantly how to address any problems you’re currently experiencing.

### Cost–benefit analysis
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Organizational, Process | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

Cost–benefit analysis (CBA), sometimes also called benefit–cost analysis, is a systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives. It is used to determine options which provide the best approach to achieving benefits while preserving savings in, for example, transactions, activities, and functional business requirements. A CBA may be used to compare completed or potential courses of action, and to estimate or evaluate the value against the cost of a decision, project, or policy. It is commonly used to evaluate business or policy decisions (particularly public policy), commercial transactions, and project investments. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission must conduct cost-benefit analyses before instituting regulations or deregulations.: 6 

CBA has two main applications:

To determine if an investment (or decision) is sound, ascertaining if – and by how much – its benefits outweigh its costs.
To provide a basis for comparing investments (or decisions), comparing the total expected cost of each option with its total expected benefits.
CBA is related to cost-effectiveness analysis. Benefits and costs in CBA are expressed in monetary terms and are adjusted for the time value of money; all flows of benefits and costs over time are expressed on a common basis in terms of their net present value, regardless of whether they are incurred at different times. Other related techniques include cost–utility analysis, risk–benefit analysis, economic impact analysis, fiscal impact analysis, and social return on investment (SROI) analysis.

### Functional requirement
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

In software engineering and systems engineering, a functional requirement defines a function of a system or its component, where a function is described as a summary (or specification or statement) of behavior between inputs and outputs.

Functional requirements may involve calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing, and other specific functionality that define what a system is supposed to accomplish. Behavioral requirements describe all the cases where the system uses the functional requirements, these are captured in use cases. Functional requirements are supported by non-functional requirements (also known as "quality requirements"), which impose constraints on the design or implementation (such as performance requirements, security, or reliability). Generally, functional requirements are expressed in the form "system must do <requirement>," while non-functional requirements take the form "system shall be <requirement>." The plan for implementing functional requirements is detailed in the system design, whereas non-functional requirements are detailed in the system architecture.

As defined in requirements engineering, functional requirements specify particular results of a system. This should be contrasted with non-functional requirements, which specify overall characteristics such as cost and reliability. Functional requirements drive the application architecture of a system, while non-functional requirements drive the technical architecture of a system.

In some cases a requirements analyst generates use cases after gathering and validating a set of functional requirements. The hierarchy of functional requirements collection and change, broadly speaking, is: user/stakeholder request → analyze → use case → incorporate. Stakeholders make a request; systems engineers attempt to discuss, observe, and understand the aspects of the requirement; use cases, entity relationship diagrams, and other models are built to validate the requirement; and, if documented and approved, the requirement is implemented/incorporated. Each use case illustrates behavioral scenarios through one or more functional requirements. Often, though, an analyst will begin by eliciting a set of use cases, from which the analyst can derive the functional requirements that must be implemented to allow a user to perform each use case.

Similar pursuits are information visualization, data visualization, statistical graphics, information design, or information architecture. Infographics have evolved in recent years to be for mass communication, and thus are designed with fewer assumptions about the readers' knowledge base than other types of visualizations. Isotypes are an early example of infographics conveying information quickly and easily to the masses.[6]

### Non-functional requirement
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Technical | **Domain:** Software Development

In systems engineering and requirements engineering, a non-functional requirement (NFR) is a requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours. They are contrasted with functional requirements that define specific behavior or functions. The plan for implementing functional requirements is detailed in the system design. The plan for implementing non-functional requirements is detailed in the system architecture, because they are usually architecturally significant requirements.

Definition
Broadly, functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do and non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to be. Functional requirements are usually in the form of "system shall do <requirement>", an individual action or part of the system, perhaps explicitly in the sense of a mathematical function, a black box description input, output, process and control functional model or IPO Model. In contrast, non-functional requirements are in the form of "system shall be <requirement>", an overall property of the system as a whole or of a particular aspect and not a specific function. The system's overall properties commonly mark the difference between whether the development project has succeeded or failed.

Non-functional requirements are often called the "quality attributes" of a system. Other terms for non-functional requirements are "qualities", "quality goals", "quality of service requirements", "constraints", "non-behavioral requirements", or "technical requirements". Informally these are sometimes called the "ilities", from attributes like stability and portability. Qualities—that is non-functional requirements—can be divided into two main categories:

Execution qualities, such as safety, security and usability, which are observable during operation (at run time).
Evolution qualities, such as testability, maintainability, extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static structure of the system.
It is important to specify non-functional requirements in a specific and measurable way.  Ref:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement

### Organizational storytelling
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Organizational, Process | **Domain:** Software Development

Organizational storytelling (also known as business storytelling) is a concept in management and organization studies. It recognises the special place of narration in human communication, making narration "the foundation of discursive thought and the possibility of acting in common.[1]" This follows the narrative paradigm, a view of human communication based on the conception of persons as homo narrans.[2]

Business organisations explicitly value "hard" knowledge that can be classified, categorized, calculated, analyzed, etc., practical know-how (explicit and tacit) and know-who (social connections). In contrast, storytelling employs ancient means of passing wisdom and culture through informal stories and anecdotes. The narrative is said to be more "synthetic" than "analytic", and help to: share norms and values, develop trust and commitment, share tacit knowledge, facilitate unlearning, and generate emotional connections.[3] Storytelling is an ingredient to make an idea "stick".[4]

While storytelling is a key ingredient in great advertising, organizational storytelling caters to a very different audience. It deals with human beings in organizations connecting, engaging and inspiring other stakeholders using stories and story structures in their communication.

### Workshop facilitation
**Type:** Transferable & Functional | **Areas:** Process | **Domain:** Networking & IoT

Workshop facilitation is the act of providing unobtrusive, objective guidance to a group in order to collaboratively progress towards a goal.

The role of the facilitator is to plan and lead activities and instruction in order to help the group do their best thinking together. Facilitation does not mean taking charge and dictating the outcome, but rather allowing each participant to contribute fully and equally and enabling a shared, collaborative outcome that the group buys into. Objectivity is key; facilitators must come from a neutral place — stepping back from contributing to focus purely on the group’s process.

Your job as facilitator is not to personally generate a superbly creative idea, nor it is to make the correct decisions. Your job is to have the workshop participants create the best ideas they can and end up with the best possible decisions.
