Practitioners use a combination of research, direct engagement, and analytical frameworks—such as stakeholder mapping, power-interest grids, and influence matrices—to build a comprehensive picture of the account’s internal dynamics. The immediate value of this skill lies in its ability to inform tailored engagement strategies, prioritize outreach, anticipate objections, and build consensus among stakeholders, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful deal closure. It is especially relevant in account-based marketing (ABM) and strategic selling, where personalized approaches and deep account insight are essential for winning and expanding high-value deals. Typical use cases include preparing for executive meetings, developing account plans, and orchestrating multi-threaded sales campaigns. Mastery of Account-Based Stakeholder Analysis is indispensable for sales teams aiming to shorten sales cycles, mitigate risks, and drive growth in competitive enterprise markets.\n\nDomain: Marketing & Sales\nDomain Description: Marketing, sales, customer acquisition, and retention\nSkill Type: Transferable and Functional\nSkill Areas: Experience, Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-39e8e92e","description_en":"Account-Based Stakeholder Analysis is a critical skill in the Business / Enterprise Sales domain, focused on systematically identifying, mapping, and prioritizing key decision-makers, influencers, and gatekeepers within large, complex client organizations.

Data with many fields (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[3] The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Thus a fourth concept, veracity, refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data. Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, then the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization's capacity to create and capture value from big data.[4]\n\nCurrent usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. \"There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem.\"[5] Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to \"spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on\".[6] Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet searches, fintech, healthcare analytics, geographic information systems, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics,[7] connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology, and environmental research.[8]\n\nThe size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices, cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices, aerial (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.[9][10] The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[11] as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5×260 bytes) of data are generated.[12] Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data.[13] According to IDC, global spending on big data and business analytics (BDA) solutions is estimated to reach $215.7 billion in 2021.[14][15] While Statista report, the global big data market is forecasted to grow to $103 billion by 2027.[16] In 2011 McKinsey & Company reported, if US healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality, the sector could create more than $300 billion in value every year.[17] In the developed economies of Europe, government administrators could save more than €100 billion ($149 billion) in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data.[17] And users of services enabled by personal-location data could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus.[17] One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.[18]\n\nRelational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data. The processing and analysis of big data may require \"massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers\".[19] What qualifies as \"big data\" varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools. Furthermore, expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. \"For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration.\"","description_en":"big data","ce":"Technical","st":"Transferable_and_Functional","ma":["Technical"],"relatesTo":[],"isCompositeOf":[],"isExtensionOf":[],"tags":[],"owner":"Thor Henning Hetland","editedBy":"User Admin","version":1,"created":"2022-05-23","lastEdited":"2022-08-25","domain":"Data & Analytics"},"33230a16-c12f-482f-be4c-89d1b7dc6c4f":{"id":"33230a16-c12f-482f-be4c-89d1b7dc6c4f","name":"Blazor","name_en":null,"description":"Blazor is a modern front-end web framework based on HTML, CSS, and C# that helps you build web apps faster.

Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.\n\nBlockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.\n\nA blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need for a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.

By the early 1980s several groups were already at work on diverse successors to MacLisp: Lisp Machine Lisp (aka ZetaLisp), Spice Lisp, NIL and S-1 Lisp. Common Lisp sought to unify, standardise, and extend the features of these MacLisp dialects. Common Lisp is not an implementation, but rather a language specification. Several implementations of the Common Lisp standard are available, including free and open-source software and proprietary products.[5] Common Lisp is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. It supports a combination of procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms. As a dynamic programming language, it facilitates evolutionary and incremental software development, with iterative compilation into efficient run-time programs. This incremental development is often done interactively without interrupting the running application.

It is used to determine options which provide the best approach to achieving benefits while preserving savings in, for example, transactions, activities, and functional business requirements. A CBA may be used to compare completed or potential courses of action, and to estimate or evaluate the value against the cost of a decision, project, or policy. It is commonly used to evaluate business or policy decisions (particularly public policy), commercial transactions, and project investments. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission must conduct cost-benefit analyses before instituting regulations or deregulations.: 6 \n\nCBA has two main applications:\n\nTo determine if an investment (or decision) is sound, ascertaining if – and by how much – its benefits outweigh its costs.\nTo provide a basis for comparing investments (or decisions), comparing the total expected cost of each option with its total expected benefits.\nCBA is related to cost-effectiveness analysis.

For example: if software processes loan applications, it might have classes like \"loan application\", \"customers\", and methods such as \"accept offer\" and \"withdraw\".\n\nDomain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:\n\nplacing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;\nbasing complex designs on a model of the domain;\ninitiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.\nCritics of domain-driven design argue that developers must typically implement a great deal of isolation and encapsulation to maintain the model as a pure and helpful construct.

Skilled users can design optimal index mappings and settings to suit specific data models and search requirements. This includes defining appropriate data types, analyzers, tokenizers, and filters to enable advanced text analysis and querying capabilities.\n\nExpertise in Elasticsearch also encompasses the ability to construct complex search queries using the Elasticsearch Query DSL (Domain Specific Language). This involves performing full-text searches, aggregations, filtering, and sorting to extract meaningful insights from the data. Knowledge of performance optimization techniques—such as tuning cluster configurations, managing resources, and scaling clusters—is crucial for maintaining efficient and reliable search operations.\n\nAdvanced Elasticsearch skills may include integrating Elasticsearch with other components of the Elastic Stack, such as Logstash for data ingestion and Kibana for data visualization. Understanding security features like role-based access control, TLS encryption, and secure communication is important for deploying Elasticsearch in production environments.

As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent releases in short development cycles, intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.\n\nOther elements of extreme programming include programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, not programming features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, code simplicity and clarity, expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers. The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to \"extreme\" levels. As an example, code reviews are considered a beneficial practice; taken to the extreme, code can be reviewed continuously (i.e. the practice of pair programming).

Behavioral requirements describe all the cases where the system uses the functional requirements, these are captured in use cases. Functional requirements are supported by non-functional requirements (also known as \"quality requirements\"), which impose constraints on the design or implementation (such as performance requirements, security, or reliability). Generally, functional requirements are expressed in the form \"system must do <requirement>,\" while non-functional requirements take the form \"system shall be <requirement>.\" The plan for implementing functional requirements is detailed in the system design, whereas non-functional requirements are detailed in the system architecture.\n\nAs defined in requirements engineering, functional requirements specify particular results of a system. This should be contrasted with non-functional requirements, which specify overall characteristics such as cost and reliability. Functional requirements drive the application architecture of a system, while non-functional requirements drive the technical architecture of a system.\n\nIn some cases a requirements analyst generates use cases after gathering and validating a set of functional requirements. The hierarchy of functional requirements collection and change, broadly speaking, is: user/stakeholder request → analyze → use case → incorporate. Stakeholders make a request; systems engineers attempt to discuss, observe, and understand the aspects of the requirement; use cases, entity relationship diagrams, and other models are built to validate the requirement; and, if documented and approved, the requirement is implemented/incorporated. Each use case illustrates behavioral scenarios through one or more functional requirements. Often, though, an analyst will begin by eliciting a set of use cases, from which the analyst can derive the functional requirements that must be implemented to allow a user to perform each use case.

HTTP/2 was developed by the HTTP Working Group (also called httpbis, where \"bis\" means \"twice\") of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). HTTP/2 is the first new version of HTTP since HTTP/1.1, which was standardized in RFC 2068 in 1997. The Working Group presented HTTP/2 to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for consideration as a Proposed Standard in December 2014,[6][7] and IESG approved it to publish as Proposed Standard on February 17, 2015 (and was updated in February 2020 in regard to TLS 1.3 and again in June 2022). The initial HTTP/2 specification was published as RFC 7540 on May 14, 2015.[10]\n\nThe standardization effort was supported by Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, Safari, Amazon Silk, and Edge browsers. Most major browsers had added HTTP/2 support by the end of 2015. About 97% of web browsers used have the capability (and 100% of \"tracked desktop\" web browsers).[13] As of July 2023, 36% (after topping out at just over 50%) of the top 10 million websites support HTTP/2.\n\nIts successor is HTTP/3, a major revision that builds on the concepts established by HTTP/2.

Unlike previous versions which relied on the well-established TCP (published in 1974), HTTP/3 uses QUIC, a multiplexed transport protocol built on UDP. On 6 June 2022, IETF published HTTP/3 as a Proposed Standard in RFC 9114.\n\nHTTP/3 uses similar semantics compared to earlier revisions of the protocol, including the same request methods, status codes, and message fields, but encodes them and maintains session state differently. However, partially due to the protocol's adoption of QUIC, HTTP/3 has lower latency and loads more quickly in real-world usage when compared with previous versions: in some cases over four times as fast than with HTTP/1.1 (which, for many websites, is the only HTTP version deployed).\n\nAs of April 2024, HTTP/3 is at least partially supported by 97% of all web browser installations and 98% of mobile web browser installations tracked by \"Can I Use\", a website that tracks and provides information on web technologies compatibility with different web browsers. HTTP/3 is supported by 29% of the top 10 million websites. It has been supported by Chromium (and derived projects including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Samsung Internet, and Opera) since April 2020 and by Mozilla Firefox since May 2021. Safari 14 implemented the protocol but it remains disabled by default.

It allows you to quickly build resource-efficient, real-time applications. You can deploy it at any scale from small edge devices to a large cluster of cloud instances.\n\nHazelcast can process data on a set of networked and clustered computers that pool together their random access memories (RAM) to let applications share data with other applications running in the cluster. When data is stored in RAM, applications run a lot faster since it does not need to be retrieved from disk and put into RAM prior to processing. Using Hazelcast, you can store and process your data in RAM, spread and replicate it across a cluster of machines; replication gives you resilience to failures of cluster members.\n\nHazelcast is implemented in Java language and has clients for Java, C++, .NET, REST, Python, Go and Node.js. Hazelcast also speaks Memcached and REST protocols.\n\nYour cloud-native applications can easily use Hazelcast. It is flexible enough to use as a data and computing platform out-of-the-box or as a framework for your own cloud-native applications and microservices.\n\nHazelcast is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Since it is delivered as a compact library, it easily plugs into your software solution.\n\nIt is designed to scale up to hundreds of members and thousands of clients. When you add new members, they automatically discover the cluster and linearly increase both the memory and processing capacity. The members maintain a TCP connection between each other and all communication is performed through this layer. Each cluster member is configured to be the same in terms of functionality. The oldest member (the first member created in the cluster) automatically performs the stored and streaming data assignment to cluster members. If the oldest member dies, the second oldest member takes over.\n\nHazelcast offers simple scalability, partitioning (sharding), and re-balancing out-of-the-box. It does not require any extra coordination processes. NoSQL and traditional databases are difficult to scale out and manage. They require additional processes for coordination and high availability. With Hazelcast, when you start another process to add more capacity, data and backups are automatically and evenly balanced.\n","description_en":"hazelcast","ce":"Technical","st":"Transferable_and_Functional","ma":["Technical"],"relatesTo":[],"isCompositeOf":[],"isExtensionOf":[],"tags":[],"owner":"Thor Henning Hetland","editedBy":"Thor Henning Hetland","version":0,"created":"2022-05-23","lastEdited":"2022-08-26","domain":"Data & Analytics"},"584b63cc-787a-446b-b977-756b448237f0":{"id":"584b63cc-787a-446b-b977-756b448237f0","name":"Helm","name_en":null,"description":"A Helm chart is a package that contains all the resources you need to deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster.

LangChain4j offers a unified API to avoid the need for learning and implementing specific APIs for each of them. To experiment with a different LLM or embedding store, you can easily switch between them without the need to rewrite your code. LangChain4j currently supports over 10 popular LLM providers and more than 15 embedding stores. Think of it as a Hibernate, but for LLMs and embedding stores.\nComprehensive Toolbox: During the past year, the community has been building numerous LLM-powered applications, identifying common patterns, abstractions, and techniques. LangChain4j has refined these into practical code. Our toolbox includes tools ranging from low-level prompt templating, memory management, and output parsing to high-level patterns like Agents and RAGs. For each pattern and abstraction, we provide an interface along with multiple ready-to-use implementations based on proven techniques. Whether you're building a chatbot or developing a RAG with a complete pipeline from data ingestion to retrieval, LangChain4j offers a wide variety of options.\nNumerous Examples: These examples showcase how to begin creating various LLM-powered applications, providing inspiration and enabling you to start building quickly.\nLangChain4j began development in early 2023 amid the ChatGPT hype. We noticed a lack of Java counterparts to the numerous Python and JavaScript LLM libraries and frameworks, and we had to fix that! Although \"LangChain\" is in our name, the project is a fusion of ideas and concepts from LangChain, Haystack, LlamaIndex, and the broader community, spiced up with a touch of our own innovation.\n\nWe actively monitor community developments, aiming to quickly incorporate new techniques and integrations, ensuring you stay up-to-date. The library is under active development. While some features from the Python version of LangChain are still being worked on, the core functionality is in place, allowing you to start building LLM-powered apps now!\n\nRef: https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j","description_en":"Langchain4j","ce":"Technical","st":"Transferable_and_Functional","ma":["Domain","Technical","Experience"],"relatesTo":[],"isCompositeOf":[],"isExtensionOf":[{"id":"9a1608f9-0488-4477-8ded-cf7b7ed8b9bb","name":"Large Language Model (LLM)"},{"id":"57a85563-d942-49cb-8867-a294e58e3d9f","name":"Generative artificial intelligence - GenAI"}],"tags":[],"owner":"Thor Henning Hetland","editedBy":"Thor Henning Hetland","version":1,"created":"2024-05-21","lastEdited":"2024-05-21","domain":"AI & Machine Learning"},"935459fa-4903-46df-84e3-1d10209393e7":{"id":"935459fa-4903-46df-84e3-1d10209393e7","name":"Language server protocol (LSP)","name_en":null,"description":"The language server protocol (LSP) is the product of standardizing the messages exchanged between a development tool and a language server process.

It involves a comprehensive process of designing, executing, and analyzing tests that simulate real-world user interactions to ensure that the application remains reliable, responsive, and scalable when subjected to varying levels of demand.\n\nKey aspects of software load testing include:\n\nTest Planning and Design: Crafting detailed test plans that outline objectives, scope, and methodologies. This involves defining realistic user scenarios, determining load patterns, and setting performance benchmarks and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, throughput, and error rates.\n\nTool Proficiency: Expertise in utilizing load testing tools and frameworks like Apache JMeter, LoadRunner, Gatling, or BlazeMeter. This includes scripting complex user behaviors, configuring test environments, and automating test executions to replicate multiple concurrent users.\n\nSimulation of Real-World Load: Creating test scenarios that accurately mimic the behavior of actual users, including login processes, data entry, transactions, and other interactive functions. This ensures that the test results are representative of real operational conditions.\n\nPerformance Monitoring: Continuously monitoring system resources during tests, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network bandwidth, and database performance. This helps in identifying how different components of the application and infrastructure respond under load.\n\nData Analysis and Bottleneck Identification: Analyzing test results to detect performance issues like slow response times, high error rates, or system crashes. This involves interpreting logs, error messages, and performance metrics to pinpoint the root causes of bottlenecks.\n\nScalability Assessment: Evaluating the application's ability to scale up or down based on user demand. This includes testing the application's performance when additional resources are added or when the load is reduced.\n\nReporting and Communication: Preparing comprehensive reports that detail the testing process, findings, and recommendations. Effective communication with stakeholders, including developers, project managers, and clients, is essential to address performance issues and plan improvements.\n\nOptimization Recommendations: Providing actionable insights for enhancing application performance. This may involve suggesting code optimizations, architectural changes, hardware upgrades, or configuration adjustments to improve scalability and reliability.\n\nKnowledge of System Architecture: Understanding the underlying architecture of the software, including servers, databases, APIs, and third-party integrations. This knowledge is crucial for designing effective tests and interpreting results accurately.\n\nCompliance and Best Practices: Ensuring that load testing practices adhere to industry standards, regulatory requirements, and organizational policies. Staying updated with the latest best practices and technologies in performance testing.\n\nContinuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) Integration: Incorporating load testing into the CI/CD pipeline to enable continuous performance assessment throughout the development lifecycle. This helps in early detection of performance issues and reduces the risk of late-stage failures.\n\nAdaptability and Problem-Solving: Being able to adjust testing strategies based on evolving requirements, technological changes, or unexpected test outcomes. Strong analytical and problem-solving skills are essential to address complex performance challenges.\n\nBy mastering software load testing, professionals ensure that applications can handle real-world demands efficiently, providing a seamless and satisfactory experience to end-users even under heavy load conditions. This skill is vital for maintaining the reputation of software products and services, reducing downtime, and preventing revenue loss due to performance-related issues.","description_en":"Load Testing","ce":"Technical","st":"Transferable_and_Functional","ma":["Technical"],"relatesTo":[],"isCompositeOf":[],"isExtensionOf":[],"tags":[],"owner":"totto@exoreaction.com","editedBy":"totto@exoreaction.com","version":0,"created":"2024-11-15","lastEdited":"2024-11-15","domain":"Data & Analytics"},"e24d168d-66ab-4662-83b0-68d4b533ac43":{"id":"e24d168d-66ab-4662-83b0-68d4b533ac43","name":"Logistics","name_en":null,"description":"Logistics is the part of supply chain management that deals with the efficient forward and reverse flow of goods, services, and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption according to the needs of customers. Logistics management is a component that holds the supply chain together. The resources managed in logistics may include tangible goods such as materials, equipment, and supplies, as well as food and other consumable items.\n\nIn military logistics, it is concerned with maintaining army supply lines with food, armaments, ammunition, and spare parts apart from the transportation of troops themselves. Meanwhile, civil logistics deals with acquiring, moving, and storing raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods. For organisations that provide garbage collection, mail deliveries, public utilities, and after-sales services, logistical problems must be addressed.\n\nLogistics deals with the movements of materials or products from one facility to another; it does not include material flow within the production or assembly plants, such as production planning or single-machine scheduling.[2] Logistics occupies a significant amount of the operational cost of an organisation or country. Logistical costs of organizations in the United States incurred about 11% of United States national gross domestic product (GDP) as of 1997. In the European Union, logistics costs were 8.8% to 11.5% of GDP as of 1993.\n\nDedicated simulation software can model, analyze, visualize, and optimize logistics' complexity. Minimizing resource use is a common motivation in all logistics fields. A professional working in logistics management is called a logistician.

A low-coded platform may produce entirely operational applications, or require additional coding for specific situations. Low-code development platforms are typically on a high abstraction level, and can reduce the amount of traditional time spent, enabling accelerated delivery of business applications. A common benefit is that a wider range of people can contribute to the application's development, not only those with coding skills, but good governance is needed to be able to adhere to common rules and regulations. LCDPs can also lower the initial cost of setup, training, deployment, and maintenance.\n\nLow-code development platforms trace their roots back to fourth-generation programming language and the rapid application development tools of the 1990s and early 2000s. Similar to these predecessor development environments, LCDPs are based on the principles of model-driven architecture, automatic code generation, and visual programming. The concept of end-user development also existed previously, although LCDPs brought some new ways of approaching this development. The low-code development platform market traces its origins back to 2011.

Azure offers a large collection of services, which includes platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and managed database service capabilities. However, what exactly is Azure, and how does it work?\n\nAzure, like other cloud platforms, relies on a technology known as virtualization. Most computer hardware can be emulated in software. Computer hardware is simply a set of instructions, which are permanently, or semi-permanently, encoded in silicon. Emulation layers are used to map software instructions to hardware instructions. Emulation layers allow virtualized hardware to execute in software like the actual hardware itself.\n\nEssentially, the cloud is a set of physical servers in one or more datacenters. The datacenters execute virtualized hardware for customers. So how does the cloud create, start, stop, and delete millions of instances of virtualized hardware for millions of customers simultaneously?\n\nTo understand the servers, let's look at the architecture of hardware in the datacenter. Inside each datacenter, there's a collection of servers sitting in server racks. Each server rack contains many server blades, and a network switch. These provide network connectivity and a power distribution unit (PDU), which creates power. Racks are sometimes grouped together in larger units known as clusters.\n\nThe server racks, or clusters, are chosen to run virtualized hardware instances for the user. However, some servers run cloud management software, known as a fabric controller. The fabric controller is a distributed application with many responsibilities. It allocates services, monitors the health of the server and the services running on it, and heals servers when they fail.\n\nEach instance of the fabric controller is connected to another set of servers running cloud orchestration software, typically known as the front end. The front end hosts the web services, RESTful APIs, and internal Azure databases, which are used for all functions in the cloud.\n\nFor example, the front end hosts the services that handle customer requests. The requests allocate Azure resources and services such as virtual machines, and Azure Cosmos DB. First, the front end validates and verifies if the user is authorized to allocate the requested resources. If so, the front end checks a database to locate a server rack with sufficient capacity, which instructs the fabric controller to allocate the resource.\n\nAzure is a huge collection of servers and networking hardware, which runs a complex set of distributed applications. These applications orchestrate the configuration and operation of virtualized hardware and software on those servers. The orchestration of these servers is what makes Azure so powerful. With Azure, users don't have to maintain and upgrade their hardware as Azure does this behind the scenes.","description_en":"azure","ce":"Technical","st":"Transferable_and_Functional","ma":["Technical"],"relatesTo":[],"isCompositeOf":[],"isExtensionOf":[],"tags":[],"owner":"Thor Henning Hetland","editedBy":"Thor Henning Hetland","version":0,"created":"2022-08-25","lastEdited":"2022-08-25","domain":"Software Development"},"916fb378-ecd3-4029-9659-85c376f68183":{"id":"916fb378-ecd3-4029-9659-85c376f68183","name":"Microsoft Bicep","name_en":null,"description":"Bicep is a domain-specific language that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources.

They are contrasted with functional requirements that define specific behavior or functions. The plan for implementing functional requirements is detailed in the system design. The plan for implementing non-functional requirements is detailed in the system architecture, because they are usually architecturally significant requirements.\n\nDefinition\nBroadly, functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do and non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to be. Functional requirements are usually in the form of \"system shall do <requirement>\", an individual action or part of the system, perhaps explicitly in the sense of a mathematical function, a black box description input, output, process and control functional model or IPO Model. In contrast, non-functional requirements are in the form of \"system shall be <requirement>\", an overall property of the system as a whole or of a particular aspect and not a specific function. The system's overall properties commonly mark the difference between whether the development project has succeeded or failed.\n\nNon-functional requirements are often called the \"quality attributes\" of a system. Other terms for non-functional requirements are \"qualities\", \"quality goals\", \"quality of service requirements\", \"constraints\", \"non-behavioral requirements\", or \"technical requirements\". Informally these are sometimes called the \"ilities\", from attributes like stability and portability. Qualities—that is non-functional requirements—can be divided into two main categories:\n\nExecution qualities, such as safety, security and usability, which are observable during operation (at run time).\nEvolution qualities, such as testability, maintainability, extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static structure of the system.\nIt is important to specify non-functional requirements in a specific and measurable way.

At the time there were new vendors moving in the enterprise Java space seemingly every week. Rather than join the space as a competitor, the project was focused entirely on providing these new platforms with a way to quickly get EJB compliance via plugging OpenEJB into their application server.\n\nThe first to integrate OpenEJB in this fashion was Apple's WebObjects in late 2000, released in 2001. When the project moved to Source Forge in 2002 an Apache Tomcat integration was created. Again rather than follow what most in the industry were doing and putting Tomcat into OpenEJB, the project decided to follow its vision and provide an integration that allowed Tomcat users to plug in OpenEJB to gain EJB support in the Tomcat platform. It was in this same vein of putting an EJB container into a Web server that the project developed the Collapsed EAR concept of putting EJBs inside the .war file.\n\nAs part of the work that OpenEJB did to prepare for the integration with Apple's WebObjects, a very large integration test suite was developed. The test suite was developed as a generic application since it would need to be run against both WebObjects and other platforms that integrated OpenEJB. For simplicity in the build the test suite based on JUnit, was run with OpenEJB right inside the tests rather than as a separate process, which was easy to do as the container was designed to be plugged into other platforms and make as little assumptions about its environment as possible. It was from this work that the concept of combining an EJB application with plain unit tests and an embeddable EJB container was born. Originally referred to as a \"local\" EJB container and what lead the project to describe itself as being able to run in two modes: Local and Remote.\n\nIn August 2003 the project helped launch the Apache Geronimo application server. Originally a new version of OpenEJB was developed ground up based on Geronimo's GBean architecture and released as OpenEJB 2.0 which lived throughout the Geronimo 1.x cycle. In 2006 when EJB 3.0 was released which had a focus on simplicity, the project went back to its roots and revived the OpenEJB 1.0 codebase, ported select bits of the 2.0 codebase, and eventually brought it up to the EJB 3.0 spec level in what is now called OpenEJB 3.0.

It recognises the special place of narration in human communication, making narration \"the foundation of discursive thought and the possibility of acting in common.[1]\" This follows the narrative paradigm, a view of human communication based on the conception of persons as homo narrans.[2]\n\nBusiness organisations explicitly value \"hard\" knowledge that can be classified, categorized, calculated, analyzed, etc., practical know-how (explicit and tacit) and know-who (social connections). In contrast, storytelling employs ancient means of passing wisdom and culture through informal stories and anecdotes. The narrative is said to be more \"synthetic\" than \"analytic\", and help to: share norms and values, develop trust and commitment, share tacit knowledge, facilitate unlearning, and generate emotional connections.[3] Storytelling is an ingredient to make an idea \"stick\".[4]\n\nWhile storytelling is a key ingredient in great advertising, organizational storytelling caters to a very different audience. It deals with human beings in organizations connecting, engaging and inspiring other stakeholders using stories and story structures in their communication.\nRef: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_storytelling","description_en":"Organizational storytelling","ce":"Communication","st":"Transferable_and_Functional","ma":["Organizational","Process"],"relatesTo":[],"isCompositeOf":[],"isExtensionOf":[],"tags":[],"owner":"Thor Henning Hetland","editedBy":"Thor Henning Hetland","version":1,"created":"2024-05-04","lastEdited":"2024-05-04","domain":"Software Development"},"eb2c0a3b-fd59-4551-815d-a03e470246ef":{"id":"eb2c0a3b-fd59-4551-815d-a03e470246ef","name":"PHP development","name_en":null,"description":"Development using the PHP language","description_en":"PHP","ce":"Technical","st":"Knowledge_Based","ma":["Technical"],"relatesTo":[{"id":"d8d730cc-3055-4dc8-97bb-abd5bc743d46","name":"Symfony"},{"id":"dca5011c-2a38-4f63-8c94-aa6079542963","name":"Laravel"}],"isCompositeOf":[{"id":"569d3580-1645-4631-b8d0-432980e07d84","name":" Systems development "}],"isExtensionOf":[{"id":"b016a8ee-988b-4ab6-b3c4-02ba52505d29","name":"Software Process"}],"tags":[],"owner":"Jan Helge Maurtvedt","editedBy":"Jan Helge Maurtvedt","version":0,"created":"2023-03-16","lastEdited":"2023-03-21","domain":"Software Development"},"dad3a49d-4942-4e87-b5c9-39ab76fa1e7b":{"id":"dad3a49d-4942-4e87-b5c9-39ab76fa1e7b","name":"PKI & Digital Certificates","name_en":null,"description":"Public key infrastructure includes the policies, roles, hardware, software, and procedures required to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates.

The test is performed to identify weaknesses (or vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.\n\nThe process typically identifies the target systems and a particular goal, then reviews available information and undertakes various means to attain that goal. A penetration test target may be a white box (about which background and system information are provided in advance to the tester) or a black box (about which only basic information other than the company name is provided). A gray box penetration test is a combination of the two (where limited knowledge of the target is shared with the auditor). A penetration test can help identify a system's vulnerabilities to attack and estimate how vulnerable it is.\n\nSecurity issues that the penetration test uncovers should be reported to the system owner. Penetration test reports may also assess potential impacts to the organization and suggest countermeasures to reduce the risk.

This skill involves applying frameworks such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), circular economy principles, and sustainability reporting standards (e.g., GRI, ISO 14040/44) to identify hotspots of resource consumption, emissions, waste generation, and social impacts. Practitioners use specialized tools (e.g., SimaPro, GaBi, OpenLCA) to quantify impacts and model scenarios for improvement. The analysis supports compliance with regulatory requirements (such as the EU Green Deal, Extended Producer Responsibility), informs eco-design and sustainable procurement decisions, and enables transparent communication of product sustainability to stakeholders and customers.

This skill involves applying frameworks such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), circular economy principles, and sustainability reporting standards (e.g., GRI, ISO 14040/44) to identify hotspots of resource consumption, emissions, waste generation, and social impacts. Practitioners use specialized tools (e.g., SimaPro, GaBi, OpenLCA) to quantify impacts and model scenarios for improvement. The analysis supports compliance with regulatory requirements (such as the EU Green Deal, Extended Producer Responsibility), informs eco-design and sustainable procurement decisions, and enables transparent communication of product sustainability to stakeholders and customers.

QUIC improves performance of connection-oriented web applications that are currently using TCP. It does this by establishing a number of multiplexed connections between two endpoints using User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and is designed to obsolete TCP at the transport layer for many applications, thus earning the protocol the occasional nickname \"TCP/2\".

A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online. SOA is also intended to be independent of vendors, products and technologies.[2]\n\nService orientation is a way of thinking in terms of services and service-based development and the outcomes of services.[1]\n\nA service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:[3]\n\n    It logically represents a repeatable business activity with a specified outcome.\n    It is self-contained.\n    It is a black box for its consumers, meaning the consumer does not have to be aware of the service's inner workings.\n    It may be composed of other services.[4]\n\nDifferent services can be used in conjunction as a service mesh to provide the functionality of a large software application,[5] a principle SOA shares with modular programming. Service-oriented architecture integrates distributed, separately maintained and deployed software components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that facilitate components' communication and cooperation over a network, especially over an IP network.\n\nSOA is related to the idea of an API (application programming interface), an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software. An API can be thought of as the service, and the SOA the architecture that allows the service to operate.

By identifying the insecure coding practices that lead to these errors and educating developers on secure alternatives, organizations can take proactive steps to help significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in software before deployment.\n\nSome scholars have suggested that in order to effectively confront threats related to cybersecurity, proper security should be coded or “baked in” to the systems.

Mail servers and other message transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages. User-level email clients typically use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying, and typically submit outgoing email to the mail server on port 587 or 465 per RFC 8314. For retrieving messages, IMAP (which replaced the older POP3) is standard, but proprietary servers also often implement proprietary protocols, e.g., Exchange ActiveSync.\n\nSMTP's origins began in 1980, building on concepts implemented on the ARPANET since 1971. It has been updated, modified and extended multiple times. The protocol version in common use today has extensible structure with various extensions for authentication, encryption, binary data transfer, and internationalized email addresses. SMTP servers commonly use the Transmission Control Protocol on port number 25 (for plaintext) and 587 (for encrypted communications).

SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems organized in a management information base (MIB), which describes the system status and configuration. These variables can then be remotely queried (and, in some circumstances, manipulated) by managing applications.\n\nThree significant versions of SNMP have been developed and deployed. SNMPv1 is the original version of the protocol. More recent versions, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, feature improvements in performance, flexibility and security.\n\nSNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an application layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.

A more narrow definition of supply chain management is the \"design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronising supply with demand and measuring performance globally\". This can include the movement and storage of raw materials, work-in-process inventory, finished goods, and end to end order fulfilment from the point of origin to the point of consumption. Interconnected, interrelated or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain.\n\nSCM is the broad range of activities required to plan, control and execute a product's flow from materials to production to distribution in the most economical way possible. SCM encompasses the integrated planning and execution of processes required to optimize the flow of materials, information and capital in functions that broadly include demand planning, sourcing, production, inventory management and logistics—or storage and transportation.\n\nSupply chain management strives for an integrated, multidisciplinary, multimethod approach. Current [when?] research in supply chain management is concerned with topics related to resilience, sustainability, and risk management, among others. Some suggest that the \"people dimension\" of SCM, ethical issues, internal integration, transparency/visibility, and human capital/talent management are topics that have, so far, been underrepresented on the research agenda.

At its core, systems engineering utilizes systems thinking principles to organize this body of knowledge. The individual outcome of such efforts, an engineered system, can be defined as a combination of components that work in synergy to collectively perform a useful function.\n\nIssues such as requirements engineering, reliability, logistics, coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability, and many other disciplines necessary for successful system design, development, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work processes, optimization methods, and risk management tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as industrial engineering, production systems engineering, process systems engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, production engineering, control engineering, software engineering, electrical engineering, cybernetics, aerospace engineering, organizational studies, civil engineering and project management. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered and integrated into a whole.\n\nThe systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high-quality outputs with minimum cost and time. The systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved and identifying the most probable or highest-impact failures that can occur. Systems engineering involves finding solutions to these problems.

Within an IP network, UDP does not require prior communication to set up communication channels or data paths.\n\nUDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an application may instead use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.\n\nUDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system.\n\nThe protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768.

Very often the team that requires a product or service to be procured for them will have a very good understanding of good options, and sometimes the best option, available. Listen to them, trust them, and better yet explicitly involve them up-front in the procurement process.\n    Work with the right vendors. Many organizations make the mistake of working with a limited number of vendors, often to simplify procurement. But, if you want the best fit, then you really need to work with a range of vendors. Larger companies tend to offer commodity services and products and are often willing to work with you to gain the specific expertise they are currently missing (this is called “learning on your dime”). Smaller companies are more leading edge but may not have the capacity for larger service engagements or large product orders. Independent contractors are often experts in a specific topic, providing the expert advice or service you require but not at the scale that you may need. \n    Build partnerships. When it comes to procured services, vendor staff will often be a critical part of your value stream. So treat them as such and embed them as closely as you can. Ideally, the integration of full-time employees (FTEs) and contractors should be so good that it’s impossible to identify which company directly employs a given person on a team. Note that some countries, particularly the US, have specific laws that limit how you are able to treat contractors and consultants and may even put an upper limit on how long they may work for you. With respect to purchased products, you may choose to co-develop and even co-produce the offerings with one or more partner firms, sharing the resulting risks and revenues of doing so.\n\nThe following strategies lead to more effective contracting: \n\n    Prefer context-sensitive contracts. The point is that a multimillion-dollar services contract will be a bit more detailed than a contract for two-day workshop. A contract for Agile services should reflect how an agile team works whereas a contract for traditional services should reflect how a traditional team works. Use the right contract for what you are trying to procure – Context counts.\n    Beware the extremes. When it comes to comparing vendors based on cost, which is a questionable strategy at best, our advice is that the vendors in the middle are often your best option. Our experience is that lowest bidder will likely produce low quality or will nickle-and-dime you via their change management strategy whereas the highest bidder either doesn’t want your business to begin with, aren’t streamlined in the way that they work and are thus higher cost, or in some cases really are the very best and know what they’re worth.\n    Prefer flexible funding contracts over fixed-bid contracts. Fixed-bid tends to focus on initial price, thus promoting a lowest-bid mindset which leads to trouble. Systems thinking tells us to end the practice of awarding business based on price tag and instead minimize the total cost (or better yet maximize the net value received). Fixed price contracts tend to be a worst case scenario for all parties involved.\n    Prefer incremental delivery contracts over big-bang contracts. The larger the contract, the greater the risk. To remove that risk, when it's possible, organize a large contract into small incremental deliverables. You reduce the cost of delay by doing so, introduce opportunities for learning and adjusting your strategy, and increase overall transparency (hence improving your ability to govern the contract).\n    Prefer outcome-based contracts over feature-based contracts. Just like your internal metrics should be outcome-focused so should your contracts. There is no guarantee that the features you defined up front will be what customers want, an unfortunate outcome of the traditional “big requirements up front (BRUF)﻿\n\n” strategy. Instead define contracts in terms of outcomes – increased sales, increased customer retention, customer growth, and so on. Effective contracts define a set of outcomes to achieve, a set of constraints, and give the team the freedom to work within that sandbox.\nAvoid detailed contractual processes. Large amounts of up-front planning tend to increase risk in complex situations. Worse yet, detailed contractual processes tend to favor incumbents and large service providers (as opposed to the right vendors), they inhibit transparency (rarely exploring the implications of how a vendor will provide a service), they are inaccurate (everyone tends to be overly optimistic), and they usually ignore outcomes in favor of outputs.\nMonitor fulfillment of contracts. Past performance is critical input into determining whether to award new work to a vendor, which is a significant motivator to act as a good partner right now. Just like regular retrospectives to identify potential improvements works well for solution delivery teams, the same technique can be applied to identify how well a contract is being fulfilled and more importantly how to address any problems you’re currently experiencing.

When you run the compiled HelloWorld application (HelloWorld.class), the agent could be viewed as a way to intercept classloaders behavior at runtime. You may think how come the java byte code will be restructured so that agent can add the relevant code at the correct places. The interesting fact is, for Java programs, the structure of the bytecode is really close to the original Java program source code. Hence, while we don’t instrument the Java program itself, we use a very close representation of it. One thing to note is that there are non-Java languages that compile into Java bytecode (such as Scala, Clojure, and Kotlin), which means that the structure and shape of the bytecode for programs can be very different.","description_en":"java agent","ce":"Technical","st":"Transferable_and_Functional","ma":["Technical"],"relatesTo":[],"isCompositeOf":[],"isExtensionOf":[],"tags":[],"owner":"Thor Henning Hetland","editedBy":"User Admin","version":2,"created":"2022-05-23","lastEdited":"2022-08-25","domain":"Software Development"},"aefe759a-66bd-4f86-9d38-51b8e037bbec":{"id":"aefe759a-66bd-4f86-9d38-51b8e037bbec","name":"java new","name_en":null,"description":" ","description_en":"java new","ce":"NotSet","st":"NotSet","ma":[],"relatesTo":[],"isCompositeOf":[],"isExtensionOf":[],"tags":[],"owner":"Selina Quadim","editedBy":"Selina Quadim","version":0,"created":"2022-12-02","lastEdited":"2022-12-02","domain":"Software Development"},"3971e83f-1832-46f2-b28f-e4a8da8a30a0":{"id":"3971e83f-1832-46f2-b28f-e4a8da8a30a0","name":"java servlet","name_en":null,"description":"A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model.

Loose coupling reduces all types of dependencies and the complexities around it, as service developers do not need to care about the users of the service, they do not force their changes onto users of the service.[1][clarification needed] Therefore it allows organizations developing software to grow fast and big, as well as use off-the-shelf services more easily.

Each message has an exact meaning intended to elicit a response from a range of possible responses pre-determined for that particular situation. The specified behavior is typically independent of how it is to be implemented. Communication protocols have to be agreed upon by the parties involved. To reach an agreement, a protocol may be developed into a technical standard. A programming language describes the same for computations, so there is a close analogy between protocols and programming languages: protocols are to communication what programming languages are to computations.
