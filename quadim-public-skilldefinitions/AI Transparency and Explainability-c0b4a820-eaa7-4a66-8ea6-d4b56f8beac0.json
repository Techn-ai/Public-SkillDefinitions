  "description" : "AI Transparency and Explainability is the technical skill of designing, developing, and deploying artificial intelligence systems in a manner that makes their internal logic, decision-making processes, and outputs understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. This skill is crucial in the current landscape, where AI models—especially those based on deep learning and large language models—are often perceived as 'black boxes.' Practitioners in this area must be proficient in methods such as model interpretability techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP, feature importance analysis), documentation best practices, and the use of explainable AI (XAI) frameworks. The skill encompasses the ability to generate clear, accessible explanations for model predictions, communicate limitations and uncertainties, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements such as the EU AI Act and GDPR's 'right to explanation.' Immediate applications include supporting risk assessments in regulated industries (finance, healthcare), enabling auditability for AI-driven decisions, and fostering user trust by making AI systems more accountable and understandable. AI Transparency and Explainability also involves collaborating with cross-functional teams to translate technical insights into actionable information for business leaders, end-users, and regulators. Mastery of this skill is essential for organizations seeking to deploy AI responsibly, mitigate bias, and avoid reputational or legal risks associated with opaque decision-making.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
