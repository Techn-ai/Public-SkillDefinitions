  "description" : "Domain-driven design (DDD) is a major software design approach, focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.\n\nUnder domain-driven design, the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example: if software processes loan applications, it might have classes like \"loan application\", \"customers\", and methods such as \"accept offer\" and \"withdraw\".\n\nDomain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:\n\nplacing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;\nbasing complex designs on a model of the domain;\ninitiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.\nCritics of domain-driven design argue that developers must typically implement a great deal of isolation and encapsulation to maintain the model as a pure and helpful construct. While domain-driven design provides benefits such as maintainability, Microsoft recommends it only for complex domains where the model provides clear benefits in formulating a common understanding of the domain.\n\nThe term was coined by Eric Evans in his book of the same title published in 2003.
