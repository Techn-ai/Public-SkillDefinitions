  "description" : "Product Lifecycle Sustainability Analysis is a critical business skill that enables organizations to systematically evaluate and enhance the environmental, social, and economic impacts of their products throughout all stages of the product lifecycle—from initial design and raw material sourcing, through manufacturing, distribution, use, and ultimately end-of-life management. This skill involves applying frameworks such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), circular economy principles, and sustainability reporting standards (e.g., GRI, ISO 14040/44) to identify hotspots of resource consumption, emissions, waste generation, and social impacts. Practitioners use specialized tools (e.g., SimaPro, GaBi, OpenLCA) to quantify impacts and model scenarios for improvement. The analysis supports compliance with regulatory requirements (such as the EU Green Deal, Extended Producer Responsibility), informs eco-design and sustainable procurement decisions, and enables transparent communication of product sustainability to stakeholders and customers. Immediate applications include identifying opportunities for material substitution, process optimization, closed-loop recycling, and product take-back programs. By integrating sustainability analysis into product development and business strategy, organizations can reduce risks, enhance brand reputation, and drive innovation aligned with circular economy goals. This skill is currently essential for companies seeking to meet investor expectations, regulatory demands, and consumer preferences for sustainable products, making it a cornerstone of responsible and competitive business practice today.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
