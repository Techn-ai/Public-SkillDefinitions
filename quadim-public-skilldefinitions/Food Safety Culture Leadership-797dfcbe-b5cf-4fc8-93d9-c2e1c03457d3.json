  "description" : "Food Safety Culture Leadership is the ability to foster, model, and sustain a workplace environment where food safety is a core organizational value, integrated into every level of operations and decision-making. This skill is critical in today's regulatory and consumer-driven landscape, where foodborne illness outbreaks and compliance failures can have immediate and severe reputational, legal, and financial consequences. Leaders with this skill actively champion food safety, ensuring that policies, behaviors, and attitudes throughout the organization align with best practices and regulatory requirements. They communicate the importance of food safety clearly, set expectations, and hold themselves and others accountable for upholding standards. Food Safety Culture Leadership involves engaging employees at all levels, empowering them to identify and address risks, and recognizing positive food safety behaviors. It requires a deep understanding of food safety principles, risk management, and change management, as well as the ability to influence and inspire others. Typical use cases include leading cross-functional food safety initiatives, responding to regulatory audits, driving continuous improvement in food handling procedures, and embedding food safety into onboarding and ongoing training. In the current environment, where supply chains are complex and consumer scrutiny is high, this skill is essential for reducing risk, ensuring compliance, and building trust with stakeholders.\n\nDomain: Leadership\nDomain Description: Team leadership, management, and organizational direction\nSkill Type: Personal Trait or Attitude\nSkill Areas: Organizational, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
