  "description" : "Data Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a structured, systematic process used to evaluate and mitigate privacy risks associated with the collection, processing, storage, and sharing of personal data within technical systems and business processes. DPIAs are a critical requirement under global data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other regional privacy laws. The primary purpose of a DPIA is to identify potential impacts on individuals’ privacy rights, assess the necessity and proportionality of data processing activities, and implement controls to reduce risks to an acceptable level. This skill involves mapping data flows, analyzing data lifecycle stages, and evaluating the technical and organizational measures in place to protect data. Practitioners must collaborate with cross-functional teams—including IT, legal, security, and business stakeholders—to ensure that privacy risks are identified early in project lifecycles and that mitigation strategies are integrated into system design (privacy by design). DPIAs are essential for launching new technologies, products, or services that involve sensitive or large-scale data processing, and for responding to regulatory inquiries or audits. The skill requires familiarity with privacy risk assessment methodologies, threat modeling, data minimization techniques, and documentation best practices. Immediate applications include supporting compliance, reducing the likelihood of data breaches, and building trust with customers and regulators by demonstrating proactive privacy management.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
