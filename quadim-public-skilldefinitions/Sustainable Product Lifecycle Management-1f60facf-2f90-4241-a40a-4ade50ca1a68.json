  "description" : "Sustainable Product Lifecycle Management (SPLM) is a critical business capability that integrates environmental, social, and economic sustainability principles into every phase of a product’s lifecycle—from initial concept and design through manufacturing, distribution, use, and end-of-life management. SPLM requires organizations to systematically assess and minimize negative environmental impacts, ensure regulatory compliance (such as with EU Ecodesign Directive, REACH, or Extended Producer Responsibility laws), and address evolving consumer expectations for ethical and eco-friendly products. This skill involves cross-functional collaboration between product development, supply chain, compliance, marketing, and sustainability teams to embed circular economy principles, such as design for recyclability, resource efficiency, and responsible sourcing. Practitioners leverage lifecycle assessment (LCA) tools, environmental impact metrics, and sustainability reporting frameworks (e.g., GRI, CDP) to inform decision-making and demonstrate progress to stakeholders. SPLM is immediately relevant as businesses face increasing pressure from regulators, investors, and consumers to reduce carbon footprints, eliminate hazardous materials, and improve product transparency. Typical use cases include redesigning packaging to reduce waste, selecting low-impact materials, implementing take-back or recycling programs, and ensuring products meet eco-label or green certification standards. Mastery of SPLM enables organizations to mitigate risks, unlock market opportunities, and build resilient, future-ready product portfolios that align with global sustainability goals.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
