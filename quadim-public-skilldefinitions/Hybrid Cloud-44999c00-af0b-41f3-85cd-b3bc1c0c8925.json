  "description" : "A hybrid cloud—sometimes called a cloud hybrid—is a computing environment that combines an on-premises datacenter (also called a private cloud) with a public cloud, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. Some people define hybrid cloud infrastructure to include \"multicloud\" configurations where an organization uses more than one public cloud in addition to their on-premises datacenter.",
