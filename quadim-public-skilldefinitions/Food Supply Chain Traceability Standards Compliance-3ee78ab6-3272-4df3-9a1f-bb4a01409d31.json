  "description" : "Food Supply Chain Traceability Standards Compliance is the technical capability to ensure that all processes, systems, and documentation within the food supply chain adhere to internationally recognized traceability standards such as ISO 22005, GS1, and the Codex Alimentarius guidelines. This skill is critical in today's globalized food industry, where the ability to trace the origin, movement, and handling of food products is essential for regulatory compliance, food safety, and consumer trust. Practitioners must understand the technical requirements of traceability standards, including data capture, record-keeping, interoperability of IT systems, and the use of standardized identifiers and barcodes. They must also be proficient in implementing and auditing traceability systems, ensuring that all supply chain actors—from primary producers to retailers—can accurately track and report product histories. Immediate applications include responding to food safety incidents, facilitating product recalls, meeting import/export regulations, and providing transparency to consumers and regulators. This skill is highly relevant today due to increasing regulatory scrutiny, the complexity of global supply chains, and the demand for transparency in food sourcing. Mastery of this skill enables organizations to participate in international trade, avoid costly compliance violations, and maintain a competitive edge in the marketplace.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
