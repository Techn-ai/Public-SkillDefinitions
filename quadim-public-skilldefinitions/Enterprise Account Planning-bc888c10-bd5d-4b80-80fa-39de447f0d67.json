  "description" : "Enterprise Account Planning is a critical business skill focused on the strategic management of large, complex client accounts within an enterprise sales context. This skill involves developing and executing structured, data-driven plans to maximize value for both the client and the selling organization. Practitioners of enterprise account planning systematically analyze client organizations, map key stakeholders, identify business drivers, and align solutions to the client's strategic objectives. The process includes setting measurable goals, forecasting revenue opportunities, and proactively identifying risks and growth areas. Effective enterprise account planning requires deep collaboration with cross-functional teams such as marketing, product, and customer success to deliver tailored solutions that address the unique needs of each enterprise client. It also involves leveraging CRM systems and account intelligence tools to maintain up-to-date knowledge of account status, competitive threats, and market trends. In today's business environment, where enterprise clients demand personalized engagement and measurable ROI, this skill is essential for building long-term, high-value relationships, increasing account retention, and driving upsell and cross-sell opportunities. Typical use cases include annual account reviews, multi-year contract negotiations, and orchestrating executive-level engagement to ensure alignment between the client's evolving needs and the organization's offerings. Mastery of enterprise account planning directly impacts revenue growth, customer satisfaction, and competitive differentiation in the enterprise sales landscape.\n\nDomain: Marketing & Sales\nDomain Description: Marketing, sales, customer acquisition, and retention\nSkill Type: Transferable and Functional\nSkill Areas: Experience, Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-39e8e92e",
