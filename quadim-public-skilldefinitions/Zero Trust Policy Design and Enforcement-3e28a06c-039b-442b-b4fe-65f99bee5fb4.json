  "description" : "Zero Trust Policy Design and Enforcement is the technical skill of architecting, implementing, and maintaining security policies that embody the Zero Trust security model—an approach that assumes no implicit trust for any user, device, or application, regardless of location, and requires continuous verification of every access request. This skill involves translating organizational security requirements into granular, context-aware policies that govern access to networks, applications, and data. Practitioners must be adept at leveraging identity and access management (IAM) solutions, network segmentation, micro-segmentation, and least privilege principles to minimize attack surfaces and lateral movement. Key tasks include defining authentication and authorization rules, integrating multi-factor authentication (MFA), monitoring policy compliance, and automating policy enforcement through tools such as policy engines, software-defined perimeters, and endpoint security platforms. Zero Trust Policy Design and Enforcement is critical for organizations facing modern threats such as ransomware, insider attacks, and supply chain compromises, as it enables adaptive, real-time risk assessment and rapid response to anomalous behavior. Typical use cases include securing remote workforces, protecting sensitive data in hybrid cloud environments, and ensuring regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). The skill requires close collaboration with IT, security operations, and compliance teams, and demands up-to-date knowledge of frameworks like NIST SP 800-207 and industry best practices. Mastery of this skill ensures that security policies are not only robust and enforceable but also agile enough to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
