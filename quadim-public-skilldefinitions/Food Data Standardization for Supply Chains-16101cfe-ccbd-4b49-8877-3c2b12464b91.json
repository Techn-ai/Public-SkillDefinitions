  "description" : "Food Data Standardization for Supply Chains is the technical skill of developing, implementing, and maintaining consistent data formats, structures, and vocabularies for food-related information across all stages of the supply chain. This skill is crucial in today's complex and globalized food industry, where data is exchanged between producers, processors, distributors, retailers, and regulators. Standardization ensures that information such as product attributes, nutritional content, allergen declarations, traceability data, and batch numbers are accurately and uniformly represented, regardless of the system or organization involved. Practitioners must be proficient in applying international standards (such as GS1, ISO 22000, and FDA Food Traceability regulations), mapping disparate data sources, and using data transformation tools to harmonize information. Immediate applications include enabling interoperability between enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, supporting real-time tracking and recall management, and ensuring compliance with food safety and labeling regulations. The skill also involves collaboration with stakeholders to define data requirements, validate data integrity, and facilitate seamless data exchange through APIs or EDI. In the current regulatory and consumer environment, where transparency, safety, and efficiency are paramount, Food Data Standardization is essential for reducing errors, improving operational efficiency, and building trust throughout the supply chain.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
