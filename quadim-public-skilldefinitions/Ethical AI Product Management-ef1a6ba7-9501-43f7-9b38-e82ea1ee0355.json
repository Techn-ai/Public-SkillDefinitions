  "description" : "Ethical AI Product Management is the practice of integrating ethical principles and responsible innovation into every stage of AI product development, deployment, and lifecycle management within business contexts. This skill requires a deep understanding of both AI technologies and the ethical, legal, and societal implications of their use. Practitioners are responsible for ensuring that AI products align with organizational values, comply with regulatory requirements (such as GDPR, EEOC, and emerging AI-specific legislation), and proactively address risks related to bias, transparency, privacy, and accountability. Key aspects include establishing ethical review processes, conducting impact assessments, and collaborating with cross-functional teams—such as data scientists, legal, compliance, and user experience professionals—to embed fairness, explainability, and inclusivity into product design. Ethical AI Product Managers must also engage with stakeholders, including customers and advocacy groups, to understand and mitigate potential harms, and to foster trust in AI-driven solutions. Typical use cases include overseeing the development of AI-powered decision systems in finance, healthcare, or HR, where ethical lapses can have significant real-world consequences. The skill is currently critical as businesses face increasing scrutiny from regulators, investors, and the public regarding the responsible use of AI. Mastery of Ethical AI Product Management enables organizations to innovate confidently while safeguarding reputation, ensuring compliance, and delivering value that respects human rights and societal norms.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
