  "description" : "Sustainability Data Quality Assurance is a technical skill focused on ensuring the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability of data used in sustainability reporting and decision-making. In the current landscape, organizations are under increasing pressure from regulators, investors, and stakeholders to provide transparent and credible sustainability disclosures, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories, energy consumption, water usage, waste management, and supply chain impacts. This skill involves designing and implementing robust data validation processes, applying data governance frameworks, and utilizing automated and manual quality checks to detect and correct errors or inconsistencies in sustainability datasets. Practitioners must be proficient in using specialized tools for data profiling, cleansing, and auditing, and should be familiar with relevant standards and protocols such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and CDP requirements. Immediate applications include supporting ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting, enabling compliance with regulatory mandates (e.g., CSRD, SEC climate disclosures), and providing reliable data for sustainability analytics and performance benchmarking. The skill also encompasses collaboration with cross-functional teams—such as sustainability, IT, and compliance—to establish data stewardship roles, document data lineage, and ensure traceability from source systems to final reports. High-quality sustainability data underpins credible sustainability strategies, risk assessments, and external communications, making this skill essential for organizations aiming to build trust and achieve their sustainability objectives in today's data-driven environment.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
