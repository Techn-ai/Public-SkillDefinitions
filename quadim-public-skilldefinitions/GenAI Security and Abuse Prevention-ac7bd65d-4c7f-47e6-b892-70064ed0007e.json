  "description" : "GenAI Security and Abuse Prevention is a critical technical skill focused on identifying, mitigating, and managing the unique security risks and abuse vectors associated with generative AI systems. As organizations rapidly adopt large language models (LLMs), image generators, and other GenAI technologies, new threats have emerged, including prompt injection, data leakage, model inversion, unauthorized content generation, and the facilitation of phishing, misinformation, or other malicious activities. This skill encompasses the ability to design, implement, and monitor robust safeguards such as input/output filtering, adversarial testing, red-teaming, and the integration of AI-specific security frameworks (e.g., OWASP Top 10 for LLMs). Practitioners must understand the technical underpinnings of GenAI models, including how they process, store, and generate data, as well as the attack surfaces unique to these systems. Key competencies include threat modeling for GenAI pipelines, abuse detection using automated and manual review processes, and the application of responsible AI principles to ensure compliance with organizational policies and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, NIST AI RMF). Immediate applications include securing customer-facing chatbots, protecting proprietary data from model leakage, and preventing the generation of harmful or non-compliant content. This skill is essential for technical professionals tasked with deploying GenAI in production environments, as it directly addresses the urgent need to safeguard organizational assets, maintain user trust, and comply with evolving legal and ethical standards in today's AI-driven landscape.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
