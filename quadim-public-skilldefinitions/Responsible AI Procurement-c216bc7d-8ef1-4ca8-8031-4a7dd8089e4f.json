  "description" : "Responsible AI Procurement is the practice of sourcing, evaluating, and acquiring artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and services in a manner that aligns with ethical standards, legal requirements, and organizational values. This skill is critical in the current business landscape, where the adoption of AI solutions is accelerating and regulatory scrutiny is increasing. Practitioners of Responsible AI Procurement ensure that vendors and products comply with relevant laws (such as GDPR, CCPA, and emerging AI regulations), organizational risk frameworks, and industry best practices for fairness, transparency, and accountability. The process involves rigorous due diligence, including assessment of AI models for bias, explainability, data privacy, and security. It also requires the integration of procurement policies that mandate supplier adherence to ethical AI principles, such as human oversight, non-discrimination, and responsible data usage. Typical use cases include drafting AI-specific RFPs, evaluating vendor compliance with AI ethics guidelines, and collaborating with legal, compliance, and IT teams to mitigate risks associated with AI adoption. This skill is immediately relevant for procurement professionals, compliance officers, and business leaders seeking to minimize reputational, legal, and operational risks while supporting innovation and trust in AI-driven solutions. By embedding responsible practices into procurement workflows, organizations can foster sustainable AI adoption, safeguard stakeholder interests, and demonstrate leadership in corporate responsibility.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
