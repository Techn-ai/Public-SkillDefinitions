  "description" : "Food Fraud Detection and Prevention is a critical technical skill focused on identifying, analyzing, and mitigating fraudulent activities within the food supply chain. This skill encompasses the use of scientific, analytical, and technological methods to detect adulteration, mislabeling, counterfeiting, and substitution of food products. Practitioners employ a combination of laboratory testing (such as DNA analysis, spectroscopy, and chromatography), data analytics, supply chain monitoring, and risk assessment to uncover intentional deception for economic gain. The skill requires a deep understanding of food science, regulatory standards (such as those set by the FDA, EU, or Codex Alimentarius), and the vulnerabilities inherent in complex, globalized food networks. Immediate applications include verifying ingredient authenticity, ensuring label accuracy, and tracing product origins to prevent entry of fraudulent goods into the market. This skill is currently of paramount importance due to the increasing sophistication of food fraud schemes, heightened consumer awareness, and stricter regulatory scrutiny. Effective food fraud detection and prevention protects public health, maintains brand integrity, and upholds consumer trust. It is essential for professionals in food manufacturing, quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and supply chain management, as it directly addresses the technical challenges of safeguarding food authenticity and safety in today’s interconnected marketplace.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
