  "description" : "Digital Food Traceability Implementation is the technical skill of designing, deploying, and maintaining digital systems that enable the end-to-end tracking and tracing of food products throughout the supply chain. This skill is crucial in today's food industry, where regulatory requirements, food safety standards, and consumer expectations demand transparent and reliable information about food origins, handling, and movement. Practitioners must understand and apply technologies such as RFID, QR codes, blockchain, and cloud-based databases to capture, store, and share data at every stage—from farm to fork. The implementation process involves integrating traceability software with existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) and warehouse management systems, ensuring data interoperability, and establishing protocols for real-time data capture and reporting. This skill also requires knowledge of food safety regulations (such as FSMA, EU 178/2002), data privacy, and cybersecurity to protect sensitive supply chain information. Typical use cases include rapid identification and recall of contaminated products, verification of product authenticity, compliance with export/import regulations, and providing consumers with accessible provenance data via digital platforms. Mastery of this skill directly supports operational efficiency, risk mitigation, and brand trust in a highly competitive and regulated market, making it a vital capability for technical professionals in food manufacturing, logistics, and retail sectors.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
