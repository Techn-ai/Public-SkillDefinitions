  "description" : "Data Storytelling for Non-Technical Audiences is the business-critical skill of translating complex data analyses into clear, compelling narratives that resonate with stakeholders who lack technical expertise. This skill bridges the communication gap between data professionals and business decision-makers, ensuring that insights derived from analytics drive understanding, alignment, and action across the organization. Practitioners must distill quantitative findings into accessible stories, using plain language, relevant analogies, and visualizations tailored to the audience’s context and business objectives. Effective data storytelling involves identifying the core message, structuring information logically, and anticipating questions or concerns from non-technical listeners. It also requires proficiency with visualization tools (such as Power BI, Tableau, or Excel), an understanding of business strategy, and the ability to connect data insights to tangible business outcomes like revenue growth, cost savings, or customer satisfaction. In today’s data-driven business environment, this skill is essential for securing executive buy-in, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and accelerating the adoption of data-driven initiatives. Typical use cases include presenting KPI dashboards to senior management, crafting persuasive business cases for new projects, and enabling sales or marketing teams to leverage data insights in client interactions. Mastery of this skill empowers organizations to make informed decisions, align teams around shared goals, and maximize the value of their data investments.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
