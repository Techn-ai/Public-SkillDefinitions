  "description" : "Prompt engineering is the process of structuring text that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.\n\nA prompt for a text-to-text language model can be a query such as \"what is Fermat's little theorem?\", a command such as \"write a poem about leaves falling\", or a longer statement including context, instructions, and conversation history. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native French speaker\". A prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as asking the model to complete \"maison → house, chat → cat, chien →\" (the expected response being dog), an approach called few-shot learning.
