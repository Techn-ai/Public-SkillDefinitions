  "description" : "Agri-Food Supply Chain Sustainability Reporting is the business-critical skill of systematically collecting, analyzing, and communicating data on the environmental, social, and economic impacts of activities across the agri-food supply chain. This skill encompasses the ability to identify relevant sustainability metrics—such as greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, biodiversity impact, labor practices, and ethical sourcing—at each stage from farm production to processing, distribution, and retail. Practitioners must be adept at applying international frameworks (e.g., GRI, SASB, TCFD), adhering to regulatory requirements, and aligning with stakeholder expectations, including those of investors, customers, and governmental bodies. The skill involves integrating data from diverse sources, ensuring data accuracy and traceability, and presenting findings in clear, actionable reports that support transparency and informed decision-making. In today's business environment, this skill is vital for agri-food companies seeking to demonstrate accountability, manage risks, and maintain market access in response to increasing regulatory scrutiny and consumer demand for sustainable practices. Typical use cases include preparing annual sustainability reports, responding to ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) disclosure requests, and supporting supply chain partners in meeting sustainability standards. Mastery of this skill enables organizations to build trust, achieve compliance, and drive continuous improvement in sustainability performance throughout the agri-food value chain.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Organizational, Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
