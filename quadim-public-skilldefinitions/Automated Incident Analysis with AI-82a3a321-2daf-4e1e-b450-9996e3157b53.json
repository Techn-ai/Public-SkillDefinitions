  "description" : "Automated Incident Analysis with AI is a critical technical skill that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect, analyze, and prioritize security incidents in real time. This skill encompasses the configuration, deployment, and management of AI-driven systems that process vast volumes of security data—such as logs, alerts, and network traffic—to identify threats, anomalies, and potential breaches with greater speed and accuracy than manual methods. Practitioners must understand how to integrate AI models with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, orchestrate automated workflows, and interpret AI-generated insights to support rapid incident response. Key competencies include knowledge of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for anomaly detection, natural language processing for threat intelligence parsing, and the use of automation tools like SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platforms. Immediate applications include triaging alerts, reducing false positives, correlating disparate data sources, and providing actionable recommendations to security teams. This skill is currently essential for minimizing the dwell time of attackers, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and enabling organizations to respond to threats at machine speed. It also requires awareness of AI explainability, model drift, and the need for continuous tuning to adapt to evolving attack techniques. Automated Incident Analysis with AI is foundational for modern security operations centers (SOCs) and is increasingly expected in technical security roles due to the growing sophistication and volume of cyber threats.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
