  "description" : "Circular Economy Strategy and Implementation is the business-critical skill of designing, executing, and managing organizational transitions from linear (take-make-dispose) models to circular systems that prioritize resource efficiency, waste minimization, and long-term value creation. This skill involves the ability to assess current business processes, identify opportunities for circularity (such as product life extension, remanufacturing, recycling, and resource sharing), and develop actionable strategies that align with both sustainability goals and commercial objectives. Practitioners must be adept at stakeholder engagement, cross-functional collaboration, and change management to drive adoption across supply chains, product development, and customer engagement. Key competencies include conducting material flow analyses, lifecycle assessments, and circular business model innovation, as well as navigating regulatory frameworks (e.g., Extended Producer Responsibility, EU Circular Economy Action Plan) and sustainability reporting standards. Immediate applications include redesigning products for durability and recyclability, implementing closed-loop supply chains, and developing new revenue streams through product-as-a-service models. The skill is highly relevant today as organizations face increasing pressure from regulators, investors, and consumers to demonstrate environmental responsibility and resilience. Mastery of Circular Economy Strategy and Implementation enables businesses to reduce costs, mitigate risks associated with resource scarcity, and build competitive advantage through sustainable innovation.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
