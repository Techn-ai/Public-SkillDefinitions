  "description" : "AI Regulatory Compliance Management is the business-critical skill of ensuring that an organization’s development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence systems adhere to current legal, regulatory, and ethical standards. As governments and international bodies rapidly introduce and update AI-specific regulations—such as the EU AI Act, U.S. Executive Orders, and sector-specific guidelines—businesses must proactively interpret, implement, and monitor compliance requirements to avoid legal penalties, operational disruptions, and reputational harm. This skill involves staying abreast of evolving regulatory landscapes, conducting risk assessments, and embedding compliance controls throughout the AI lifecycle, from data collection and model training to deployment and monitoring. Practitioners must coordinate with legal, technical, and business teams to develop robust governance frameworks, document compliance evidence, and respond to audits or regulatory inquiries. Key competencies include regulatory analysis, policy interpretation, cross-functional communication, and the use of compliance management tools (e.g., OneTrust, TrustArc, or bespoke GRC platforms). Immediate applications include mapping AI use cases to risk categories, implementing transparency and explainability measures, managing data privacy and bias mitigation, and preparing compliance reports for stakeholders. In today’s environment, where regulatory scrutiny is intensifying and public trust in AI is paramount, effective AI Regulatory Compliance Management is essential for maintaining market access, securing partnerships, and sustaining long-term business value.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
