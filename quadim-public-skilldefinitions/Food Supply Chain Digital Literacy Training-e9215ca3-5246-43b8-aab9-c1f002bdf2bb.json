  "description" : "Food Supply Chain Digital Literacy Training is a technical skill focused on equipping professionals within the food supply chain sector with the foundational digital competencies necessary to effectively operate, adapt to, and optimize digital supply chain systems. This skill encompasses the ability to understand, navigate, and utilize digital platforms and tools that are integral to modern food logistics, inventory management, traceability, and compliance. As food supply chains become increasingly digitized, workers must be proficient in using enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, digital inventory tracking, electronic data interchange (EDI), and blockchain-based traceability solutions. The training covers secure data entry, digital documentation, real-time communication platforms, and the interpretation of analytics dashboards for decision-making. Immediate applications include reducing manual errors, improving transparency, enhancing food safety compliance, and enabling rapid response to disruptions such as recalls or supply shortages. Food Supply Chain Digital Literacy Training is currently vital due to the rapid adoption of digital technologies in response to regulatory requirements, consumer demand for transparency, and the need for operational resilience. Typical use cases include onboarding new staff to digital systems, upskilling existing employees to handle digital transformation initiatives, and ensuring compliance with digital record-keeping standards. This skill is foundational for workforce adaptation, supporting both efficiency and competitiveness in today's food industry.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
