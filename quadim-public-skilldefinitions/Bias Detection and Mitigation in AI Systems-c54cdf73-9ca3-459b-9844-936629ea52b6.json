  "description" : "Bias Detection and Mitigation in AI Systems is the technical skill of systematically identifying, analyzing, and reducing unwanted biases in artificial intelligence models and their underlying data. This skill is crucial in today's landscape, where AI-driven decisions directly impact individuals and communities in areas such as hiring, lending, healthcare, law enforcement, and content moderation. Practitioners must be proficient in statistical analysis, algorithmic auditing, and the use of specialized tools (e.g., Fairness Indicators, IBM AI Fairness 360, What-If Tool) to uncover disparate impacts and measure fairness metrics such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and disparate impact ratio. The skill encompasses understanding sources of bias—including data collection, labeling, and model selection—and applying mitigation strategies such as re-sampling, re-weighting, adversarial debiasing, and post-processing adjustments. It also involves integrating fairness constraints into model training and validating outcomes through rigorous testing and stakeholder feedback. Effective bias detection and mitigation require collaboration with domain experts, ethicists, and affected communities to ensure interventions are contextually appropriate and legally compliant. This skill is immediately relevant due to increasing regulatory scrutiny (e.g., EU AI Act, US EEOC guidance) and public demand for transparent, equitable AI systems. Mastery of this skill enables organizations to build trustworthy AI, reduce reputational and legal risks, and promote social responsibility in technology deployment.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
