  "description" : "IoT-Enabled Temperature Control in Food Logistics is a technical skill focused on the deployment, integration, and management of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to monitor and regulate temperature conditions throughout the food supply chain. This skill is currently of critical importance due to stringent food safety regulations, the increasing complexity of global food distribution networks, and the need to minimize spoilage and waste of temperature-sensitive products such as dairy, meat, seafood, and pharmaceuticals. Practitioners must understand how to implement sensor networks that provide real-time temperature data from storage facilities, transport vehicles, and distribution centers. The skill encompasses configuring IoT devices, establishing secure data transmission protocols, and integrating sensor data with centralized monitoring platforms or cloud-based analytics systems. It also involves setting up automated alerts and control mechanisms to maintain optimal temperature ranges, ensuring compliance with standards such as HACCP and FSMA. Immediate applications include cold chain management, rapid response to temperature excursions, and data-driven optimization of logistics operations. Mastery of this skill enables organizations to enhance product quality, reduce liability, and improve operational transparency. It requires familiarity with IoT hardware, wireless communication protocols (e.g., LoRaWAN, Zigbee), data analytics, and the unique challenges of food logistics environments, such as variable power sources and harsh conditions.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
