  "description" : "Post-Harvest Loss Assessment and Mitigation is a critical technical skill focused on identifying, quantifying, and reducing the loss of agricultural products after harvest but before reaching the consumer. This skill encompasses the systematic evaluation of losses occurring during handling, storage, processing, packaging, transportation, and distribution. Practitioners use a combination of field surveys, laboratory analysis, and data-driven methodologies to assess the extent and causes of post-harvest losses, which can include spoilage, pest infestation, mechanical damage, and improper storage conditions. The mitigation aspect involves designing and implementing targeted interventions such as improved storage technologies (e.g., hermetic storage, cold chains), optimized logistics, better handling practices, and training for stakeholders throughout the supply chain. This skill is immediately relevant in addressing global food security challenges, reducing food waste, and increasing profitability for producers and distributors by maximizing the usable yield of crops. It is particularly vital in regions where infrastructure is limited and losses can reach significant proportions, directly impacting livelihoods and market efficiency. Typical use cases include developing loss-reduction strategies for staple crops, advising agribusinesses on best practices, and supporting governmental or NGO-led food security programs. Mastery of this skill requires a strong understanding of agricultural systems, supply chain logistics, and the technical aspects of food preservation and quality control.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
