  "description" : "AI Explainability and Interpretability is the technical skill of making artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models transparent, understandable, and accountable to human stakeholders. This skill involves applying methods, frameworks, and tools that clarify how AI models arrive at their predictions, classifications, or recommendations. It is critical in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and insurance, where compliance with legal standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and ethical guidelines requires clear justification of automated decisions. Practitioners leverage techniques such as feature importance analysis, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and model-agnostic or model-specific visualization tools to demystify complex models, including deep neural networks and ensemble methods. The skill also encompasses the ability to communicate technical findings to non-technical audiences, enabling informed decision-making and fostering trust among users, regulators, and business leaders. Immediate applications include auditing AI systems for bias, validating model fairness, supporting model governance, and ensuring that AI-driven processes can be scrutinized and defended in audits or legal proceedings. Mastery of AI Explainability and Interpretability is essential for responsible AI deployment, risk management, and the operationalization of AI in mission-critical environments where transparency is non-negotiable.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
