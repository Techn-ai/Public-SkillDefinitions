  "description" : "MQTT (originally an initialism of MQ Telemetry Transport[a]) is a lightweight, publish-subscribe, machine to machine network protocol for message queue/message queuing service. It is designed for connections with remote locations that have devices with resource constraints or limited network bandwidth, such as in the Internet of Things (IoT). It must run over a transport protocol that provides ordered, lossless, bi-directional connectionsâ€”typically, TCP/IP, but also possibly over QUIC.[4] It is an open OASIS standard and an ISO recommendation (ISO/IEC 20922).
