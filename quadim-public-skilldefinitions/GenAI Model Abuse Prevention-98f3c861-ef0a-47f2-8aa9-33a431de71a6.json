  "description" : "GenAI Model Abuse Prevention is a critical technical skill focused on identifying, mitigating, and managing the risks associated with the malicious use and abuse of generative AI models. As organizations increasingly deploy large language models and other generative AI systems in production environments, the potential for misuse—such as prompt injection, data leakage, model inversion, generation of harmful or biased content, and unauthorized access—poses significant threats to security, compliance, and brand reputation. This skill encompasses the implementation of robust safeguards, including input/output filtering, adversarial testing, red teaming, and continuous monitoring for anomalous or policy-violating behaviors. Practitioners must be adept at integrating technical controls such as rate limiting, content moderation APIs, and user authentication, as well as leveraging threat intelligence to stay ahead of emerging attack vectors. Additionally, GenAI Model Abuse Prevention requires a strong understanding of regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, NIST AI Risk Management Framework), organizational policies, and ethical considerations to ensure compliance and responsible AI deployment. Typical use cases include securing customer-facing chatbots, protecting proprietary data in enterprise AI applications, and enforcing usage policies in AI-powered content generation platforms. This skill is immediately relevant and essential today, as the rapid adoption of generative AI technologies has outpaced the development of standardized safeguards, making proactive abuse prevention a cornerstone of secure and trustworthy AI operations.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
