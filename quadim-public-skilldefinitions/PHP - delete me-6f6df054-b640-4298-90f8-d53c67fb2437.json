  "description" : "PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor; used to stand for Personal Home Page) is a scripting language that helps people make web pages more interactive by allowing them to do things that can't be done with technologies running on the visitors computer. PHP code is run on the web server (the website's computer). It is called a preprocessor because it builds the information before sending it to the computer that visits the web page.\n\nA website programmed with PHP can have pages that are password protected. A website without PHP or similar technologies can't do this, as the visitor can find a way to access the page. For example, by finding where the password is stored. Standard PHP file extensions are (but not only): .php, .php3, and .phtml, but a web server can be set up to use any extension.  Ref: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP",
