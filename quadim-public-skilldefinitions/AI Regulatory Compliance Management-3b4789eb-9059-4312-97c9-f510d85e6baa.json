  "description" : "AI Regulatory Compliance Management is the business-critical skill of ensuring that organizational use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems aligns with current legal, regulatory, and ethical standards. As governments and international bodies rapidly introduce new AI-specific regulations—such as the EU AI Act, U.S. executive orders, and sector-specific guidelines—businesses face increasing pressure to demonstrate responsible AI deployment and risk mitigation. This skill involves interpreting and operationalizing complex regulatory requirements, conducting AI risk assessments, and implementing robust governance frameworks. Practitioners must stay abreast of evolving laws, such as data privacy (GDPR, CCPA), algorithmic transparency, bias mitigation, and model explainability mandates. Key activities include mapping AI system inventories, performing compliance gap analyses, developing and updating AI policies, and coordinating with legal, IT, and data science teams to ensure ongoing adherence. Effective AI Regulatory Compliance Management reduces legal and reputational risk, supports ethical innovation, and fosters trust with customers, partners, and regulators. It also encompasses the use of compliance management tools, audit trails, and documentation practices to evidence conformity during regulatory reviews or audits. In today's environment, this skill is essential for organizations deploying AI in high-impact areas such as finance, healthcare, HR, and public services, where non-compliance can result in significant penalties, operational disruption, or loss of market access.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
