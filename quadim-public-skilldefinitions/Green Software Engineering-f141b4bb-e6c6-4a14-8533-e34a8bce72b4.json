  "description" : "Green Software Engineering is the practice of designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining software systems with a primary focus on minimizing their environmental impact. This skill integrates sustainability principles into the software development lifecycle, emphasizing energy efficiency, resource optimization, and carbon footprint reduction. Practitioners apply techniques such as efficient algorithm design, code optimization, and judicious use of cloud resources to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with software operation. Green Software Engineering also involves selecting sustainable hosting options, leveraging renewable energy-powered data centers, and utilizing tools for measuring and reporting software-related emissions (e.g., the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification). It requires familiarity with regulatory requirements, such as the EU Green Deal and emerging sustainability standards, ensuring compliance and supporting organizational ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals. Typical use cases include optimizing backend services to reduce server load, refactoring legacy applications for lower energy usage, and integrating sustainability metrics into DevOps pipelines. This skill is increasingly important today as organizations face mounting pressure from regulators, customers, and investors to demonstrate environmental responsibility. By embedding sustainability into technical decision-making, Green Software Engineering enables companies to reduce operational costs, enhance brand reputation, and contribute meaningfully to global climate action.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
