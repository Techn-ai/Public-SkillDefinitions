  "description" : "AI-Enabled Regulatory Reporting is the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to automate, streamline, and enhance the process of regulatory compliance reporting across industries such as finance, healthcare, and energy. This skill involves leveraging AI-driven data extraction, natural language processing (NLP), and advanced analytics to collect, validate, and format large volumes of structured and unstructured data in accordance with complex regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, MiFID II, Dodd-Frank, HIPAA). Practitioners must understand both the technical underpinnings of AI systems and the domain-specific compliance frameworks to ensure that reports are accurate, timely, and auditable. Key competencies include integrating AI tools with existing enterprise data sources, configuring algorithms to detect anomalies or non-compliance, and automating the generation and submission of regulatory documents. Immediate applications include automating financial transaction reporting, monitoring for suspicious activities, and ensuring real-time compliance with evolving legal standards. The skill is highly relevant today as organizations face increasing regulatory scrutiny, data volumes, and the need to reduce manual effort and human error. Mastery of this skill enables technical professionals to deliver cost-effective, scalable, and transparent compliance solutions, freeing up human resources for higher-value tasks and improving overall data governance. It also requires familiarity with regulatory technology (RegTech) platforms, data privacy considerations, and the ability to interpret regulatory changes into actionable AI workflows.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
