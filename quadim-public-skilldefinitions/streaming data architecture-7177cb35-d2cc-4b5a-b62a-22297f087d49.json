  "description" : "Streaming data characteristic includes high volume of continuously generated data, at high velocity. In short, certain events generate data continuously and these form a data stream. The simplest examples of such events could be an IoT device sensor measuring pressure or a person clicking a link on a website or mobile application. The streaming data may have unstructured or semi-structured form, usually key-value pairs in JSON or XML. \n\n",
