  "description" : "Agri-Food Supply Chain Risk Assessment is a critical business skill focused on the identification, evaluation, and mitigation of risks that threaten the integrity, efficiency, and sustainability of agri-food supply chains. This skill is highly relevant in today's globalized and volatile environment, where agri-food supply chains face a multitude of risks including climate change, geopolitical instability, regulatory shifts, food safety incidents, supply disruptions, and market volatility. Practitioners must systematically analyze each link in the supply chain—from primary production and processing to distribution and retail—using both qualitative and quantitative methods to map vulnerabilities and assess the likelihood and impact of various risk scenarios. The skill involves the application of risk management frameworks, scenario planning, and real-time data analytics to anticipate disruptions, ensure compliance with food safety and traceability standards, and maintain business continuity. Effective agri-food supply chain risk assessment enables organizations to proactively develop contingency plans, diversify sourcing, optimize inventory, and strengthen supplier relationships. It is essential for ensuring food security, protecting brand reputation, and meeting consumer expectations for safe, reliable, and sustainable food products. This skill is immediately valuable for supply chain managers, risk analysts, procurement professionals, and business leaders operating in the agri-food sector, as it directly supports operational resilience and strategic decision-making in a rapidly changing business landscape.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Organizational, Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
