  "description" : "Zero Trust Security Architecture Implementation is the comprehensive process of designing, deploying, and maintaining security frameworks that operate on the principle of 'never trust, always verify.' Unlike traditional perimeter-based security models, Zero Trust assumes that threats can originate from both inside and outside the network, requiring continuous authentication, strict access controls, and granular segmentation of resources. This skill involves the integration of identity and access management (IAM), multi-factor authentication (MFA), micro-segmentation, least privilege enforcement, and real-time monitoring across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments. Practitioners must assess organizational assets, map data flows, and implement policy engines that dynamically evaluate user, device, and application trustworthiness before granting access. The skill is highly relevant today due to the proliferation of remote work, increased cloud adoption, and the sophistication of cyber threats such as ransomware and supply chain attacks. Effective Zero Trust implementation reduces attack surfaces, limits lateral movement, and enhances incident response capabilities. Typical use cases include securing remote workforce access, protecting sensitive data in SaaS applications, and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks like NIST SP 800-207 and CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model. Mastery of this skill requires cross-functional collaboration, deep technical knowledge of network and cloud architectures, and the ability to align security controls with business objectives.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
