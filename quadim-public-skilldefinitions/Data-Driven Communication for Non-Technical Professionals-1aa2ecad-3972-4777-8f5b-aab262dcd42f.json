  "description" : "Data-Driven Communication for Non-Technical Professionals is the ability to effectively interpret, translate, and present data insights to audiences without a technical background, ensuring that complex quantitative information is accessible, actionable, and relevant to business objectives. This skill is essential in today’s data-centric business environment, where decision-making increasingly relies on data but stakeholders often lack technical expertise. Practitioners bridge the gap between data analysts or data scientists and business leaders, clients, or cross-functional teams by distilling key findings, trends, and recommendations into clear narratives. This involves selecting appropriate data visualizations, using plain language, and contextualizing insights within the business’s strategic goals. The skill also requires an understanding of the audience’s needs, potential biases, and the organizational context to tailor messages for maximum impact. Typical use cases include presenting sales performance dashboards to executives, summarizing customer analytics for marketing teams, or communicating operational metrics to frontline staff. Mastery of this skill enhances collaboration, accelerates informed decision-making, and fosters a data-driven culture across the organization. It is immediately relevant for roles in management, sales, marketing, HR, and operations, where the ability to communicate data insights can drive alignment, support change initiatives, and improve business outcomes.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
