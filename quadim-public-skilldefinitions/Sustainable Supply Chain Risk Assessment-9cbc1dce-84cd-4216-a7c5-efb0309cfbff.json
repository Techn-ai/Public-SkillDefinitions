  "description" : "Sustainable Supply Chain Risk Assessment is the systematic identification, evaluation, and mitigation of risks within supply chains, with a specific focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors alongside traditional operational and financial risks. This skill is increasingly critical for organizations seeking to comply with evolving regulations (such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive), meet stakeholder expectations, and protect brand reputation in a globalized market. Practitioners must integrate sustainability frameworks (e.g., GRI, SASB, ISO 20400) into risk mapping, supplier audits, and scenario analysis to uncover vulnerabilities related to climate change, resource scarcity, labor practices, and ethical sourcing. The process involves engaging with suppliers to assess their sustainability performance, leveraging data analytics and digital platforms for real-time risk monitoring, and collaborating across procurement, compliance, and sustainability teams to develop actionable mitigation strategies. Immediate applications include supplier risk scoring, ESG compliance checks, and the implementation of corrective action plans to address identified risks. The skill also requires staying current with regulatory trends, industry best practices, and stakeholder demands, ensuring that risk assessments are both comprehensive and adaptive. By embedding sustainability into supply chain risk management, organizations can reduce exposure to disruptions, enhance resilience, and create long-term value for both business and society.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
