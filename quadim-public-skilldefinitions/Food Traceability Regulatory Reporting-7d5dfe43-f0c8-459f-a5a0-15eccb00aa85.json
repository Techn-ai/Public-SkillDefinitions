  "description" : "Food Traceability Regulatory Reporting is a technical skill focused on the accurate, timely, and compliant documentation and submission of food traceability data to regulatory authorities. This skill is critical in the current landscape, where food safety, supply chain transparency, and regulatory compliance are under intense scrutiny due to increasing incidents of foodborne illnesses, recalls, and globalized supply chains. Practitioners must understand and interpret complex regulatory frameworks such as the FDA’s Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Rule 204, EU General Food Law, and other jurisdiction-specific mandates. The skill involves gathering, validating, and structuring traceability data—such as batch numbers, origin, processing, and distribution details—across multiple digital systems (e.g., ERP, WMS, blockchain platforms). It requires the ability to generate and format reports that meet regulatory specifications, often within strict deadlines, and to respond to audits or inquiries with precise, verifiable information. Immediate applications include supporting recall management, demonstrating compliance during inspections, and enabling rapid response to food safety incidents. The skill also encompasses data privacy considerations, secure data transmission, and the use of standardized data formats (e.g., GS1, XML, CSV). Mastery of Food Traceability Regulatory Reporting ensures organizations maintain market access, avoid penalties, and build consumer trust through transparent and accountable supply chain practices.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
