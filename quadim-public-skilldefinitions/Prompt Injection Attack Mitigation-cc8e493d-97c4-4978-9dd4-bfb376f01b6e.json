  "description" : "Prompt Injection Attack Mitigation is the specialized technical skill of identifying, preventing, and responding to prompt injection attacks targeting AI-powered systems, particularly large language models (LLMs) and conversational agents. As AI applications become increasingly integrated into critical workflows, attackers exploit vulnerabilities by crafting malicious prompts that manipulate model behavior, extract confidential data, or bypass intended safeguards. This skill encompasses a deep understanding of the mechanics of prompt injection, including direct and indirect injection vectors, context manipulation, and prompt chaining. Practitioners must be proficient in designing robust input validation and sanitization pipelines, implementing context-aware access controls, and leveraging AI-specific security frameworks (such as OWASP Top 10 for LLMs). Immediate applications include securing chatbots, virtual assistants, AI-driven customer support, and any system where user input influences model outputs. The skill also involves monitoring for anomalous prompt patterns, conducting red-teaming exercises, and integrating automated detection tools to flag suspicious activity. Effective mitigation requires collaboration with software engineers, security analysts, and AI researchers to ensure layered defenses and rapid incident response. Mastery of this skill is crucial for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and safety of AI systems in production today, directly addressing a rapidly evolving threat landscape and ensuring compliance with emerging AI security standards.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
