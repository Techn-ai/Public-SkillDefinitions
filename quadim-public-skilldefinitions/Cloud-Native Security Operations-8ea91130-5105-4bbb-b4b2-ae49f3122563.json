  "description" : "Cloud-Native Security Operations is the practice of designing, implementing, and managing security controls and processes specifically tailored to cloud-native environments, such as those built on microservices, containers, serverless architectures, and orchestrated platforms like Kubernetes. This skill addresses the unique security challenges introduced by the dynamic, distributed, and ephemeral nature of cloud-native workloads, which differ significantly from traditional monolithic or on-premises systems. Practitioners must understand how to secure infrastructure-as-code (IaC), automate security policy enforcement, and integrate security into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure rapid, consistent protection across all stages of the software development lifecycle. Key aspects include runtime threat detection, vulnerability management for container images, identity and access management (IAM) tailored to cloud-native resources, network segmentation using service meshes, and compliance monitoring in highly dynamic environments. Cloud-Native Security Operations also involves leveraging cloud provider security services, open-source tools (e.g., Falco, Aqua, Prisma Cloud), and integrating with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms for real-time visibility and incident response. This skill is critical today as organizations accelerate cloud adoption, requiring security teams to adapt to new paradigms and ensure robust protection without hindering agility or scalability. Typical use cases include securing Kubernetes clusters, automating compliance checks, detecting lateral movement in containerized environments, and responding to cloud-native security incidents in real time.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
