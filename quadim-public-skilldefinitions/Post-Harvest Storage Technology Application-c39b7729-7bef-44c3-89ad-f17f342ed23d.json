  "description" : "Post-Harvest Storage Technology Application is the technical skill of selecting, implementing, and managing appropriate storage technologies to preserve the quality, safety, and market value of harvested crops. This skill is crucial in modern agriculture and food supply chains, where minimizing post-harvest losses directly impacts food security, profitability, and sustainability. Practitioners must understand the biological and environmental factors that contribute to spoilage, such as temperature, humidity, pests, and microbial activity, and apply suitable technologies—ranging from traditional methods like controlled atmosphere storage and drying, to advanced solutions such as cold chain logistics, hermetic storage, and sensor-based monitoring systems. Effective application involves evaluating crop-specific requirements, assessing available infrastructure, and integrating technologies that optimize shelf life while maintaining nutritional and sensory qualities. The skill also encompasses knowledge of regulatory standards, safety protocols, and cost-benefit analysis to ensure compliance and economic viability. In practice, this may involve configuring refrigeration units for perishable fruits, deploying modified atmosphere packaging for grains, or utilizing IoT-enabled systems for real-time monitoring. The ability to adapt storage solutions to local contexts, resource constraints, and market demands is essential. As global food systems face increasing pressure from climate change and population growth, the immediate application of post-harvest storage technology is vital for reducing waste, ensuring food availability, and supporting livelihoods across the agricultural value chain.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
