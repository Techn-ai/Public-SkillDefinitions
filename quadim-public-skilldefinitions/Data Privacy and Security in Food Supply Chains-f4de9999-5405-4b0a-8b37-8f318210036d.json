  "description" : "Data Privacy and Security in Food Supply Chains is a critical technical skill focused on safeguarding sensitive information throughout the lifecycle of food products, from production and processing to distribution and retail. This skill encompasses the application of robust cybersecurity measures, data encryption, access controls, and compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR, FSMA, and other regional data protection laws. Practitioners must understand the unique challenges posed by the interconnected nature of modern food supply chains, which often involve multiple stakeholders, IoT devices, cloud-based platforms, and third-party logistics providers. The skill requires the ability to identify and mitigate risks related to data breaches, unauthorized access, and cyberattacks that could compromise proprietary recipes, supplier contracts, shipment tracking, and consumer data. Immediate applications include implementing secure data exchange protocols between partners, ensuring traceability without exposing confidential business information, and conducting regular audits to detect vulnerabilities. Maintaining data privacy and security is essential for regulatory compliance, protecting brand reputation, and fostering trust among consumers, suppliers, and regulatory bodies. This skill is currently of paramount importance as food supply chains become increasingly digitized and targeted by cyber threats, making it indispensable for technical professionals responsible for IT infrastructure, compliance, and risk management in the food industry.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
