  "description" : "When you deal with unstructured data, you will have to go through this same feature engineering process. However, unstructured data is likely to have many more pertinent features, and performing manual feature engineering is bound to be untenable.\n\nIn those cases, we can use vector embeddings as a form of automatic feature engineering. Instead of manually picking the required features from our data, we apply a pre-trained machine learning model that will produce a representation of this data that is more compact while preserving whatâ€™s meaningful about the data.
