  "description" : "Sustainable IT Procurement is the practice of integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into the purchasing and lifecycle management of information technology products and services. This skill involves evaluating and selecting IT hardware, software, and services based not only on cost and performance, but also on their environmental impact, ethical sourcing, energy efficiency, recyclability, and supplier labor practices. Practitioners must be adept at interpreting sustainability certifications (such as EPEAT, Energy Star, and TCO Certified), understanding supply chain transparency, and assessing vendor ESG disclosures. Sustainable IT Procurement supports organizational ESG targets by reducing carbon footprints, minimizing electronic waste, and promoting circular economy principles through responsible disposal, refurbishment, or recycling of IT assets. It also requires collaboration with internal stakeholders (e.g., IT, finance, legal, and sustainability teams) and external partners (vendors, auditors, and regulators) to ensure compliance with relevant standards and regulations. Typical use cases include drafting RFPs with sustainability clauses, conducting supplier sustainability assessments, and reporting on IT procurement’s contribution to organizational sustainability goals. In today’s business landscape, this skill is critical for organizations seeking to mitigate risks, enhance brand reputation, and meet stakeholder expectations for responsible technology sourcing. Its immediate relevance is underscored by increasing regulatory requirements and investor scrutiny around ESG performance.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
