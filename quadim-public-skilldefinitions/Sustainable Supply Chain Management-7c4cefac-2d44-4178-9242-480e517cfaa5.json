  "description" : "Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) is the practice of designing, overseeing, and optimizing supply chain operations to minimize environmental impact, promote social responsibility, and ensure economic viability. In today’s business landscape, SSCM is a critical competency as organizations face increasing regulatory requirements, stakeholder scrutiny, and consumer demand for ethical and eco-friendly practices. This skill involves integrating sustainability principles into procurement, production, logistics, and distribution processes, ensuring that resources are sourced responsibly, waste is minimized, and emissions are reduced across the value chain. Practitioners must be adept at supplier engagement, lifecycle analysis, risk assessment, and compliance with frameworks such as ISO 14001, GRI, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. SSCM also requires collaboration with internal and external stakeholders to set measurable sustainability targets, implement traceability systems (e.g., blockchain for provenance), and transparently report on environmental and social performance. Typical use cases include developing green procurement policies, conducting supplier audits for ethical labor practices, optimizing transportation routes to lower carbon footprints, and managing end-of-life product recycling programs. By embedding sustainability into supply chain strategy, businesses can enhance resilience, reduce costs, mitigate reputational risks, and create long-term value for shareholders and society. SSCM is immediately relevant as companies navigate global disruptions, regulatory changes, and the urgent need to address climate change.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
