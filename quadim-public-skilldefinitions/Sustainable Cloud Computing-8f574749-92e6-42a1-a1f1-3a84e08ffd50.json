  "description" : "Sustainable Cloud Computing is the practice of designing, deploying, and managing cloud-based IT resources with a focus on minimizing environmental impact and maximizing energy efficiency. This skill involves optimizing cloud infrastructure, workloads, and services to reduce energy consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives. Practitioners leverage cloud-native tools and features—such as autoscaling, serverless architectures, and resource scheduling—to ensure that compute, storage, and networking resources are used efficiently and only when needed. Key competencies include monitoring and analyzing cloud resource utilization, selecting energy-efficient data center regions, and implementing green software engineering principles. Sustainable Cloud Computing also requires familiarity with carbon accounting frameworks, sustainability reporting tools (e.g., AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool, Microsoft Emissions Impact Dashboard), and regulatory standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Immediate applications include right-sizing virtual machines, optimizing data storage policies, and integrating renewable energy sources into cloud operations. This skill is critical for organizations seeking to reduce operational costs, meet regulatory requirements, and demonstrate commitment to sustainability in their digital transformation journeys. By embedding sustainability into cloud strategies, technical professionals can drive measurable reductions in carbon footprint while maintaining high performance and scalability for modern applications.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
