  "description" : "Real-time computing (RTC) is the computer science term for hardware and software systems subject to a \"real-time constraint\", for example from event to system response.[1] Real-time programs must guarantee response within specified time constraints, often referred to as \"deadlines\".[2]\n\nThe term \"real-time\" is also used in simulation to mean that the simulation's clock runs at the same speed as a real clock.\n\nReal-time responses are often understood to be in the order of milliseconds, and sometimes microseconds. A system not specified as operating in real time cannot usually guarantee a response within any timeframe, although typical or expected response times may be given. Real-time processing fails if not completed within a specified deadline relative to an event; deadlines must always be met, regardless of system load.\n\nA real-time system has been described as one which \"controls an environment by receiving data, processing them, and returning the results sufficiently quickly to affect the environment at that time\".[3] The term \"real-time\" is used in process control and enterprise systems to mean \"without significant delay\".\n\nReal-time software may use one or more of the following: synchronous programming languages, real-time operating systems (RTOSes), and real-time networks, each of which provide essential frameworks on which to build a real-time software application.
