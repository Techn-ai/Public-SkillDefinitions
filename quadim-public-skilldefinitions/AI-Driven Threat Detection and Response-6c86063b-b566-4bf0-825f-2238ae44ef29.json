  "description" : "AI-Driven Threat Detection and Response is a critical technical skill that involves leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify, analyze, and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real time. This skill encompasses the deployment and management of AI-powered security solutions that continuously monitor network traffic, user behavior, and system logs to detect anomalies, malware, phishing attempts, and other forms of cyberattacks. Practitioners must understand how to integrate AI models—such as supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms—into security information and event management (SIEM) systems, endpoint detection and response (EDR) platforms, and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS). Key competencies include configuring and tuning AI models for high accuracy and low false positives, interpreting AI-generated alerts, and orchestrating automated or semi-automated incident response workflows. The skill also requires knowledge of adversarial machine learning, threat intelligence feeds, and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, NIST). AI-driven approaches are essential today due to the increasing volume, velocity, and sophistication of cyber threats that outpace traditional rule-based systems. Typical use cases include rapid identification of zero-day exploits, detection of insider threats, and automated containment of ransomware attacks. Mastery of this skill enables organizations to proactively defend against evolving threats, reduce response times, and minimize the impact of security incidents, making it a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity operations.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
