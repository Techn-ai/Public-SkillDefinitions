  "description" : "Ethical Data Stewardship is a critical leadership skill that encompasses the responsible management, governance, and oversight of data assets within an organization. In today’s data-driven environment, leaders are expected to champion practices that ensure data is collected, stored, processed, shared, and disposed of in ways that are transparent, lawful, and aligned with ethical principles. This skill involves establishing and enforcing policies that protect individual privacy, uphold data subject rights, and prevent misuse or unauthorized access to sensitive information. Leaders practicing ethical data stewardship must be conversant with relevant regulations (such as GDPR, CCPA), industry standards, and emerging best practices in data ethics. They are responsible for fostering a culture of accountability and trust, ensuring that all stakeholders—from employees to customers and partners—understand the value and risks associated with data. This includes implementing robust data governance frameworks, conducting regular risk assessments, and promoting data literacy across the organization. Ethical Data Stewardship also requires balancing business objectives with societal expectations, such as minimizing bias in data-driven decision-making and ensuring transparency in algorithmic processes. Typical use cases include overseeing the ethical use of AI and analytics, managing third-party data sharing agreements, and responding to data breaches with integrity and transparency. Ultimately, this skill is essential for building and maintaining stakeholder trust, safeguarding organizational reputation, and ensuring long-term business sustainability in a rapidly evolving regulatory and technological landscape.\n\nDomain: Leadership\nDomain Description: Team leadership, management, and organizational direction\nSkill Type: Personal Trait or Attitude\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
