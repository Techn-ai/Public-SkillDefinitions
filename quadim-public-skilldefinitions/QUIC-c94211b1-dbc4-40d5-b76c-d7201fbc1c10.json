  "description" : "QUIC (/kwÉªk/) is a general-purpose transport layer network protocol initially designed by Jim Roskind at Google,[3] implemented, and deployed in 2012, announced publicly in 2013 as experimentation broadened, and described at an IETF meeting. QUIC is used by more than half of all connections from the Chrome web browser to Google's servers.[9] Microsoft Edge (which, after version 1, is a derivative of the open-source Chromium browser), Firefox, and Safari support it.\n\nAlthough its name was initially proposed as the acronym for \"Quick UDP Internet Connections\", IETF's use of the word QUIC is not an acronym; it is simply the name of the protocol. QUIC improves performance of connection-oriented web applications that are currently using TCP. It does this by establishing a number of multiplexed connections between two endpoints using User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and is designed to obsolete TCP at the transport layer for many applications, thus earning the protocol the occasional nickname \"TCP/2\".
