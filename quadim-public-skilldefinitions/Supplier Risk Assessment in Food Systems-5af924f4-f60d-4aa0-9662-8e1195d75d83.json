  "description" : "Supplier Risk Assessment in Food Systems is a critical business skill focused on systematically identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks associated with suppliers within the food supply chain. This skill is essential in today's globalized and highly regulated food industry, where disruptions, quality failures, or non-compliance by suppliers can have immediate and severe consequences, including product recalls, legal penalties, reputational damage, and threats to consumer safety. Practitioners of this skill employ a combination of risk analysis methodologies, supplier audits, compliance checks, and ongoing monitoring to assess factors such as food safety standards, traceability, ethical sourcing, geopolitical risks, and supplier financial stability. The process involves close collaboration with procurement, quality assurance, and regulatory teams to ensure that all suppliers meet stringent requirements for food safety (e.g., HACCP, GFSI), sustainability, and legal compliance. Immediate applications include onboarding new suppliers, conducting periodic risk reviews, responding to supply chain disruptions (such as those caused by pandemics or geopolitical events), and ensuring compliance with evolving regulations like FSMA or EU food safety directives. By proactively managing supplier risks, organizations can enhance supply chain resilience, maintain product integrity, and protect brand reputation. This skill is indispensable for food manufacturers, distributors, and retailers seeking to maintain operational continuity and regulatory compliance in a complex, fast-moving market.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Organizational, Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
