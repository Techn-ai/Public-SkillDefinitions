  "description" : "Data Ethics and Bias Mitigation is a critical technical skill focused on identifying, evaluating, and addressing ethical concerns and biases within data-driven systems, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications. This skill encompasses the understanding and application of ethical frameworks, regulatory requirements (such as GDPR, CCPA), and industry standards to ensure that data collection, processing, and algorithmic decision-making are conducted responsibly and transparently. Practitioners in this area are adept at recognizing sources of bias—such as sampling bias, measurement bias, and algorithmic bias—and implementing strategies to reduce or eliminate their impact. This involves techniques like fairness-aware modeling, bias audits, explainable AI (XAI), and the use of de-biasing algorithms. The skill also requires collaboration with cross-functional teams to establish data governance policies, conduct impact assessments, and communicate ethical risks to stakeholders. Immediate applications include auditing datasets for representativeness, monitoring deployed models for disparate impact, and ensuring compliance with emerging AI ethics guidelines. The value of this skill lies in supporting organizational trust, legal compliance, and social responsibility, while enhancing the fairness and reliability of technical systems. In today’s environment, where AI systems influence critical decisions in finance, healthcare, hiring, and more, Data Ethics and Bias Mitigation is essential for building equitable and accountable technology.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
