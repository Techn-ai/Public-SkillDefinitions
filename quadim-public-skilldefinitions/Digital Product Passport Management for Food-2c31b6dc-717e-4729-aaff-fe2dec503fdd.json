  "description" : "Digital Product Passport Management for Food is the technical skill of designing, implementing, and maintaining digital systems that capture, store, and manage comprehensive product information for food items throughout their lifecycle in the supply chain. This skill is crucial for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements (such as the EU Digital Product Passport initiative), enhancing transparency, and supporting traceability from production to end consumer. Practitioners must be adept at integrating data from diverse sources, including ingredient origins, processing methods, certifications, batch tracking, and logistics, into interoperable digital records. These digital passports enable stakeholders—producers, distributors, retailers, regulators, and consumers—to access real-time, verifiable information about food products, supporting food safety, recall management, and sustainability claims. The skill involves knowledge of data standards (e.g., GS1, blockchain-based traceability), secure data exchange protocols, and regulatory frameworks governing food information. It also requires the ability to work with APIs, cloud platforms, and digital identity solutions to ensure data integrity, privacy, and accessibility. In today’s environment, where food fraud, allergen management, and sustainability are pressing concerns, effective digital product passport management is immediately valuable for risk mitigation, building consumer trust, and meeting legal obligations. Typical use cases include automating compliance reporting, enabling rapid recalls, and providing consumers with transparent product histories via QR codes or mobile apps.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
