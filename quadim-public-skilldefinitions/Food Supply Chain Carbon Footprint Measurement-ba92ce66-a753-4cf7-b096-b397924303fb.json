  "description" : "Food Supply Chain Carbon Footprint Measurement is a technical skill focused on the systematic quantification, analysis, and management of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated throughout the various stages of the food supply chain. This includes emissions from agricultural production, processing, transportation, storage, distribution, retail, and even end-of-life waste management. Practitioners use internationally recognized methodologies such as the GHG Protocol, ISO 14064, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to collect data, model emissions, and report findings. The skill requires proficiency in data collection from diverse sources (e.g., farm inputs, energy use, logistics), application of emission factors, and the use of specialized software tools for carbon accounting. It is critical for organizations seeking to identify emission hotspots, set reduction targets, and comply with regulatory frameworks such as the EU Green Deal, California’s SB 1383, or corporate sustainability reporting standards (e.g., CDP, GRI). Immediate applications include supplier engagement, product labeling (carbon footprint labels), and supporting climate action strategies. This skill is increasingly important today due to heightened regulatory scrutiny, consumer demand for transparency, and the urgent need for climate mitigation in the agri-food sector. Mastery of this skill enables technical professionals to drive sustainability initiatives, reduce operational risks, and enhance the environmental credibility of food businesses.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
