  "description" : "AI Incident Response and Recovery Planning is a critical technical skill focused on preparing organizations to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from incidents involving artificial intelligence systems. As AI technologies are increasingly integrated into business operations, the risks associated with AI—such as model failures, adversarial attacks, data poisoning, algorithmic bias, and unintended autonomous behavior—demand specialized incident management strategies. This skill encompasses the development and implementation of robust incident response frameworks tailored to AI-specific threats, including the creation of playbooks, escalation procedures, and communication protocols for technical and non-technical stakeholders. Practitioners must be adept at leveraging monitoring tools (e.g., AI observability platforms, anomaly detection systems), conducting root cause analyses, and coordinating cross-functional teams to contain and mitigate incidents. Recovery planning involves restoring affected AI services, validating model integrity, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements (such as GDPR or industry-specific AI governance standards). The skill also includes post-incident review processes to capture lessons learned and update policies, models, and controls accordingly. Immediate applications include responding to real-time model drift, mitigating the impact of compromised AI-driven decision systems, and ensuring business continuity in the face of AI-related disruptions. Mastery of this skill is essential for organizations seeking to minimize operational, reputational, and legal risks associated with AI deployment in today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
