  "description" : "Identity management is the process of authenticating and authorizing security principals. It also involves controlling information about those principals (identities). Security principals (identities) may include services, applications, users, groups, etc. Microsoft identity and access management solutions help IT protect access to applications and resources across the corporate datacenter and into the cloud. Such protection enables additional levels of validation, such as multifactor authentication and Conditional Access policies. Monitoring suspicious activity through advanced security reporting, auditing, and alerting helps mitigate potential security issues. Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 provides single sign-on (SSO) to thousands of cloud software as a service (SaaS) apps and access to web apps that you run on-premises.",
