  "description" : "Real-Time Food Product Tracking and Recall Management is a critical technical skill that enables organizations in the food industry to monitor, trace, and manage food products throughout the supply chain with immediate responsiveness. This skill involves the integration and application of advanced technologies such as IoT sensors, RFID tagging, blockchain, and centralized data management systems to provide continuous, up-to-date visibility into the movement and status of food products from production to point-of-sale. Practitioners must be adept at configuring and maintaining tracking systems, interpreting data streams, and responding rapidly to incidents that may compromise food safety. In the event of contamination, mislabeling, or other safety breaches, this skill allows for the swift identification of affected batches, precise localization of products, and initiation of targeted recalls, thereby minimizing public health risks and reducing regulatory penalties. Real-time tracking also supports compliance with stringent food safety regulations (such as FSMA and EU traceability requirements) and enhances consumer trust by ensuring transparency and accountability. Typical use cases include responding to pathogen outbreaks, allergen mislabeling, or supply chain disruptions. Mastery of this skill requires a strong understanding of data integration, supply chain logistics, regulatory frameworks, and incident response protocols. Its immediate relevance is underscored by increasing regulatory scrutiny, consumer demand for transparency, and the need to mitigate reputational and financial risks associated with food safety incidents.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
