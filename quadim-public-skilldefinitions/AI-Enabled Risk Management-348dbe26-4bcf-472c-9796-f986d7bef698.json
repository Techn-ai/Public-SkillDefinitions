  "description" : "AI-Enabled Risk Management is the application of artificial intelligence technologies to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate risks within business environments. This skill involves leveraging machine learning, natural language processing, and advanced analytics to process large volumes of structured and unstructured data from diverse sources—such as financial records, market trends, regulatory updates, and social media—to detect emerging threats and vulnerabilities in real time. Practitioners use AI-driven tools to automate risk detection, prioritize risk responses, and generate actionable insights, enabling organizations to respond swiftly to operational, financial, compliance, and reputational risks. Key components include the integration of AI models with existing risk management frameworks, continuous monitoring of risk indicators, and the use of predictive analytics to forecast potential disruptions. AI-Enabled Risk Management also requires strong data governance, ethical considerations (such as bias mitigation and transparency), and cross-functional collaboration between risk, IT, and business units. Typical use cases include fraud detection, supply chain risk analysis, regulatory compliance monitoring, and scenario planning. This skill is currently critical for organizations seeking to enhance resilience, improve decision quality, and maintain competitive advantage in rapidly changing business landscapes. Its immediate value lies in reducing manual effort, increasing accuracy, and enabling more agile, data-driven risk management processes.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
