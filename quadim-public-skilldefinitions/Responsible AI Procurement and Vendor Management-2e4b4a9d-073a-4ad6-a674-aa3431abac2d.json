  "description" : "Responsible AI Procurement and Vendor Management is a critical business skill focused on the evaluation, acquisition, and oversight of third-party artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to ensure they align with organizational values, regulatory requirements, and societal expectations. This skill involves developing and implementing procurement processes that rigorously assess AI vendors for compliance with ethical guidelines, data privacy laws (such as GDPR or CCPA), and sustainability standards. Practitioners must be adept at drafting and negotiating contracts that include clauses for algorithmic transparency, bias mitigation, explainability, and ongoing monitoring of AI system performance. The skill also encompasses conducting due diligence on vendors’ AI development practices, supply chain ethics, and environmental impact, as well as establishing frameworks for risk assessment and mitigation. In today’s business environment, where AI adoption is accelerating, organizations face increasing scrutiny from regulators, customers, and stakeholders regarding the responsible use of AI. Effective Responsible AI Procurement and Vendor Management ensures that AI solutions do not introduce legal liabilities, reputational risks, or unintended harms. Typical use cases include selecting AI-powered HR tools that avoid discriminatory outcomes, sourcing customer analytics platforms that respect user consent, and managing relationships with cloud AI providers to ensure compliance with evolving standards. This skill is immediately relevant for procurement managers, compliance officers, and business leaders tasked with integrating AI into their operations while upholding ethical and sustainable business practices.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
