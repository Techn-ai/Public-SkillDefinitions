  "description" : "Post-Harvest Loss Assessment and Mitigation is a critical business skill focused on identifying, quantifying, and reducing losses that occur after agricultural products are harvested but before they reach the consumer. This skill is essential for agribusiness professionals, supply chain managers, food processors, and logistics coordinators who are responsible for maximizing value, ensuring food security, and improving profitability. The assessment component involves systematic evaluation of loss points throughout the supply chain, including storage, transportation, processing, and distribution. It requires the use of data collection, analysis techniques, and key performance indicators to measure both quantitative and qualitative losses, such as spoilage, shrinkage, and quality degradation. The mitigation aspect encompasses the development and implementation of strategies to minimize these losses, such as adopting improved storage technologies, optimizing logistics, enhancing packaging, and training staff in best handling practices. In the current business environment, where food waste directly impacts both economic outcomes and sustainability goals, this skill is immediately relevant. It enables organizations to reduce costs, increase supply chain efficiency, comply with regulatory standards, and contribute to global food security. Typical use cases include conducting loss audits for agribusinesses, designing intervention programs for food distributors, and implementing traceability systems to monitor product integrity. Mastery of this skill empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions that enhance competitiveness and resilience in the agri-food sector.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Organizational, Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
