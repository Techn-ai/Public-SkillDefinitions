  "description" : "GenAI Output Traceability is the technical capability to systematically track, document, and audit the outputs generated by artificial intelligence models—particularly generative AI systems such as large language models, image generators, and code synthesis tools. This skill encompasses the design and implementation of mechanisms that capture metadata about model inputs, outputs, versioning, prompt history, and the contextual parameters influencing each generation event. It is essential for ensuring accountability, transparency, and compliance with regulatory requirements such as the EU AI Act, as well as internal governance standards. Practitioners must be proficient in integrating traceability features into AI pipelines, leveraging tools such as audit logs, cryptographic hashes, data lineage frameworks, and model registries. They must also understand how to balance traceability with privacy, security, and performance considerations. Immediate applications include supporting incident investigations, enabling reproducibility of AI-driven decisions, facilitating external audits, and providing evidence for responsible AI claims. GenAI Output Traceability is increasingly critical in sectors like finance, healthcare, and legal, where explainability and auditability are mandated. The skill also involves familiarity with relevant standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 42001), and the ability to collaborate with compliance, data governance, and engineering teams to operationalize traceability at scale. Mastery of this skill is vital for organizations seeking to deploy generative AI responsibly and maintain trust with stakeholders.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
