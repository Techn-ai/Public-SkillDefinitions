  "description" : "Practical Data Literacy for Business Professionals is the ability to confidently interpret, analyze, and communicate data-driven insights within a business context, without requiring advanced technical or programming expertise. This skill empowers non-technical staff—including managers, marketers, HR professionals, and operations personnel—to engage with data as a routine part of their decision-making processes. It encompasses understanding key data concepts such as data types, data quality, and basic statistical measures, as well as the ability to read and interpret dashboards, reports, and visualizations generated by business intelligence (BI) tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio). Practical data literacy also involves asking the right questions of data, recognizing biases or limitations, and applying findings to real-world business challenges such as customer segmentation, sales forecasting, and process optimization. In today’s data-driven business environment, this skill is crucial for fostering organizational agility, supporting evidence-based strategies, and enhancing cross-functional collaboration. It enables professionals to bridge the gap between technical data teams and business stakeholders, ensuring that data insights are actionable and aligned with organizational goals. Typical use cases include evaluating campaign performance, identifying operational inefficiencies, and supporting strategic planning with data-backed recommendations. Mastery of this skill is immediately relevant, as organizations increasingly expect all staff to leverage data for competitive advantage.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
