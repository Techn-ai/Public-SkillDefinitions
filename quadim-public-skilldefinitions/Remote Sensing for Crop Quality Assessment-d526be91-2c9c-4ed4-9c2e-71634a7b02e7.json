  "description" : "Remote Sensing for Crop Quality Assessment is a specialized technical skill that involves the application of remote sensing technologies—such as satellite imagery, drone-based sensors, and aerial photography—to evaluate the quality of agricultural crops in real time. This skill encompasses the selection, calibration, and deployment of multispectral, hyperspectral, and thermal sensors to capture data on crop health indicators, including chlorophyll content, moisture levels, disease presence, and nutrient deficiencies. Practitioners must be proficient in processing and interpreting large geospatial datasets using advanced image analysis techniques, such as vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI), machine learning algorithms, and spatial modeling. The immediate value of this skill lies in its ability to provide objective, scalable, and timely assessments of crop quality across large and inaccessible areas, supporting critical decisions in supply chain management, precision agriculture, and food safety compliance. By enabling early detection of quality issues, optimizing harvest timing, and facilitating traceability, remote sensing for crop quality assessment directly contributes to reducing waste, improving yield consistency, and enhancing the efficiency of agricultural operations. This skill is currently vital for agronomists, supply chain analysts, and agricultural technologists who must ensure product quality and meet regulatory standards in a rapidly evolving agri-food sector.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
