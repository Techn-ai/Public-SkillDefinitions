  "description" : "Customer Success Metrics for Enterprise Accounts is the specialized skill of identifying, tracking, analyzing, and leveraging quantitative and qualitative indicators that measure the health, value realization, and overall success of large, strategic customer relationships. In the context of enterprise accounts, these metrics go beyond basic customer satisfaction to encompass complex, multi-dimensional data points such as Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Health Score, product adoption rates, expansion and renewal rates, time-to-value, and executive engagement. Practitioners of this skill must be adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams to define success criteria tailored to each enterprise client, aligning metrics with both the customer’s business objectives and the vendor’s strategic goals. This skill is critical for proactively identifying risks and opportunities within high-value accounts, enabling customer success managers (CSMs) to drive retention, upsell, and advocacy. It also involves presenting actionable insights to internal stakeholders and customer executives, often using dashboards and business reviews to demonstrate ROI and business impact. In today’s business environment, where enterprise customers expect measurable outcomes and personalized engagement, mastery of customer success metrics is essential for maintaining competitive advantage, reducing churn, and fostering long-term partnerships. Typical use cases include quarterly business reviews (QBRs), executive reporting, and designing interventions to improve customer health and satisfaction.\n\nDomain: Marketing & Sales\nDomain Description: Marketing, sales, customer acquisition, and retention\nSkill Type: Transferable and Functional\nSkill Areas: Experience, Technical\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-39e8e92e",
