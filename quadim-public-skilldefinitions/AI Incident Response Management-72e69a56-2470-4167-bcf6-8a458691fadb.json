  "description" : "AI Incident Response Management is the systematic process of preparing for, detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from incidents involving artificial intelligence systems. This skill is critical in today's technology landscape, where AI models and systems are increasingly integrated into core business operations, decision-making, and customer-facing applications. AI incidents can include model failures, adversarial attacks, data poisoning, bias amplification, privacy breaches, and unintended consequences resulting from autonomous decision-making. Effective AI Incident Response Management ensures organizations can rapidly identify and assess the impact of such incidents, coordinate cross-functional response teams, and implement mitigation strategies to minimize operational, reputational, and regulatory risks. This skill requires familiarity with AI system architectures, monitoring tools, forensic analysis techniques, and incident management frameworks (such as NIST or ISO standards). It also involves maintaining incident playbooks, conducting regular tabletop exercises, and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical guidelines, including data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) and AI-specific governance policies. Practitioners must collaborate with data scientists, engineers, legal, and communications teams to ensure transparent reporting and continuous improvement. Immediate applications include responding to AI-driven fraud detection failures, mitigating the impact of generative AI misuse, and addressing real-time model drift in production environments. Mastery of this skill is essential for organizations seeking to maintain trust, resilience, and regulatory compliance in the face of rapidly evolving AI threats.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
