  "description" : "AI Risk Communication for Executives is a critical leadership skill that enables senior leaders to understand, articulate, and manage the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in their organizations. This skill involves translating complex technical and ethical AI risk concepts—such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, model transparency, regulatory compliance, and operational disruption—into clear, actionable insights for executive audiences. Leaders proficient in this skill can facilitate informed decision-making by ensuring that AI-related risks are accurately identified, prioritized, and communicated across the C-suite and boardroom. They are adept at contextualizing AI risks within the broader business strategy, aligning risk mitigation with organizational goals, and fostering a culture of responsible AI adoption. Practical applications include leading risk assessment discussions, briefing stakeholders on emerging AI threats, integrating AI risk considerations into enterprise risk management frameworks, and supporting transparent communication with regulators, investors, and the public. This skill is currently essential as organizations rapidly deploy AI solutions, facing increasing scrutiny from regulators and stakeholders regarding ethical use, security, and societal impact. By mastering AI Risk Communication, executives can proactively address potential pitfalls, build trust, and ensure that AI initiatives drive value while minimizing unintended consequences.\n\nDomain: Leadership\nDomain Description: Team leadership, management, and organizational direction\nSkill Type: Personal Trait or Attitude\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
