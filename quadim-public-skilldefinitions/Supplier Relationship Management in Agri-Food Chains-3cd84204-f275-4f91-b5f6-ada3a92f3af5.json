  "description" : "Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) in Agri-Food Chains is the strategic and operational process of developing, maintaining, and optimizing collaborative partnerships with suppliers throughout the agricultural and food production supply chain. This skill is crucial in today's business environment, where agri-food chains face increasing complexity due to globalization, regulatory requirements, food safety concerns, and consumer demand for transparency and sustainability. Effective SRM in this context involves building trust, ensuring consistent quality, and fostering open communication with suppliers ranging from smallholder farmers to large-scale processors. Practitioners must be adept at negotiating mutually beneficial agreements, managing performance through key performance indicators (KPIs), and implementing risk mitigation strategies to address issues such as supply disruptions, price volatility, and compliance with food safety standards (e.g., HACCP, GlobalG.A.P.). The skill also encompasses the use of digital tools for supplier evaluation, traceability, and data sharing, which are increasingly important for real-time decision-making and regulatory compliance. By excelling in SRM, businesses can enhance product quality, reduce operational risks, drive innovation through supplier collaboration, and achieve greater supply chain resilience. Typical use cases include joint product development with ingredient suppliers, implementing sustainable sourcing programs, and responding rapidly to food safety incidents. In summary, SRM in Agri-Food Chains is a vital competency for ensuring reliable, ethical, and efficient supply chains in the modern agri-food sector.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Organizational, Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
