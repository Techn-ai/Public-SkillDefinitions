  "description" : "Temperature Monitoring and Control in Food Transportation is a critical technical skill focused on ensuring that perishable food products are maintained within safe temperature ranges throughout the logistics and distribution process. This skill involves the real-time use of digital sensors, data loggers, and automated control systems to continuously track and regulate the temperature inside transport vehicles such as refrigerated trucks, containers, and railcars. Practitioners must understand the technical specifications of temperature-sensitive foods, regulatory standards (such as HACCP, FDA, and EU regulations), and the operation of IoT-enabled monitoring devices. The skill encompasses the ability to interpret temperature data, respond to deviations, and implement corrective actions to prevent spoilage, contamination, and loss of product quality. It also requires knowledge of alarm systems, remote monitoring platforms, and integration with fleet management software for traceability and compliance reporting. Immediate applications include ensuring food safety during long-haul shipments, maintaining cold chain integrity for pharmaceuticals and dairy, and providing audit trails for regulatory inspections. This skill is currently indispensable due to heightened food safety regulations, consumer demand for transparency, and the global nature of food supply chains. Mastery of this skill directly impacts public health, reduces waste, and supports business reputation by preventing costly recalls and ensuring consistent product quality.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
