  "description" : "Hydrologic analyses are performed to quantify the volumetric flow rate of water draining from a watershed (i.e., drainage area) over time. The amount of water that flows from a watershed depends on the characteristics of the watershed (e.g., size, land cover, antecedent moisture, and steepness) and the presence of water (e.g., the intensity and duration of a precipitation event, or regulation from a dam). Hydraulic analyses are performed to determine the depth of flow, flow velocity, and forces from flowing water on a surface or at hydraulic structures. These studies are necessary components in the hydraulic design and analysis of structures.",
