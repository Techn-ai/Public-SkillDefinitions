  "description" : "  Lucene is a full-text search library in Java which makes it easy to add search functionality to an application or website.\n\nIt does so by adding content to a full-text index. It then allows you to perform queries on this index, returning results ranked by either the relevance to the query or sorted by an arbitrary field such as a document's last modified date.\n\nThe content you add to Lucene can be from various sources, like a SQL/NoSQL database, a filesystem, or even from websites.",
