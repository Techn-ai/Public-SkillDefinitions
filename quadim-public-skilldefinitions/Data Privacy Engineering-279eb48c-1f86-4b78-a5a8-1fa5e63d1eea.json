  "description" : "Data Privacy Engineering is the technical discipline focused on designing, building, and maintaining systems that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and lawful processing of personal and sensitive data. This skill is critical in today's digital landscape, where organizations must comply with a complex web of global privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other emerging frameworks. Data Privacy Engineering involves embedding privacy-by-design principles into software development lifecycles, architecting systems to minimize data exposure, and implementing robust technical controls such as encryption, access management, data minimization, and anonymization. Practitioners must collaborate with legal, compliance, and security teams to translate regulatory requirements into actionable technical safeguards, conduct privacy impact assessments, and ensure ongoing monitoring and auditing of data flows. Typical use cases include building consent management platforms, designing secure data storage and transfer mechanisms, and automating data subject rights (DSR) processes such as access, deletion, and portability. The skill also encompasses the evaluation and integration of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), such as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption, to reduce risk while enabling data-driven innovation. Data Privacy Engineering is essential for safeguarding consumer trust, reducing the risk of data breaches and regulatory penalties, and enabling organizations to responsibly leverage data for business value in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
