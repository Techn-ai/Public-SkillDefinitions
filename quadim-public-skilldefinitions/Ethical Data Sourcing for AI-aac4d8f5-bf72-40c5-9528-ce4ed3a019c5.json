  "description" : "Ethical Data Sourcing for AI is the technical skill of acquiring, curating, and managing datasets for artificial intelligence systems in a manner that rigorously adheres to ethical, legal, and societal standards. This skill encompasses the identification and evaluation of data sources to ensure compliance with privacy regulations (such as GDPR, CCPA), intellectual property rights, and organizational data governance policies. Practitioners must be adept at recognizing and mitigating biases in data collection, selection, and labeling processes, as biased datasets can lead to discriminatory or unreliable AI outcomes. Key competencies include conducting data provenance checks, performing risk assessments for data sensitivity, and implementing consent management protocols. Ethical Data Sourcing for AI also involves collaborating with legal, compliance, and domain experts to validate the legitimacy and appropriateness of data sources, as well as documenting sourcing decisions for auditability and transparency. In present-day applications, this skill is critical for organizations deploying AI in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public services, where the consequences of unethical data use can be severe. Typical use cases include sourcing medical records for diagnostic models, collecting user data for personalization algorithms, and aggregating public datasets for language models, all while ensuring fairness, accountability, and respect for individual rights. Mastery of this skill reduces reputational, legal, and operational risks, and is foundational for building trustworthy and socially responsible AI systems.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
