  "description" : "Interoperability of Food Supply Chain Data Platforms is the technical capability to enable seamless, secure, and accurate data exchange between diverse digital systems used throughout the food supply chain. This skill encompasses the design, implementation, and management of standardized protocols, data formats, and integration frameworks that allow disparate platforms—such as farm management systems, logistics tracking, inventory databases, and retail analytics—to communicate and share information in real time. In today's complex and globalized food industry, interoperability is crucial for enhancing traceability, ensuring food safety, and improving operational efficiency. It allows stakeholders to track products from farm to fork, respond rapidly to recalls or contamination events, and optimize inventory and logistics through data-driven decision-making. Key aspects include understanding and applying data standards (such as GS1, ISO 22005, or blockchain-based traceability), utilizing APIs and middleware for system integration, and ensuring data security and privacy compliance. Typical use cases involve integrating supplier data with retailer platforms, automating compliance reporting, and enabling transparent consumer information. Mastery of this skill requires both technical knowledge of integration technologies and a deep understanding of food supply chain processes, making it immediately relevant for IT professionals, supply chain managers, and food safety specialists working to modernize and secure the food ecosystem.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
