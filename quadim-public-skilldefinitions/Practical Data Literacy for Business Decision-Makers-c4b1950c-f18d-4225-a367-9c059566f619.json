  "description" : "Practical Data Literacy for Business Decision-Makers is the ability of non-technical leaders and managers to confidently interpret, question, and apply data insights to real-world business decisions. This skill bridges the gap between complex data analysis and actionable business strategy, empowering decision-makers to foster a data-driven culture across their organizations. It encompasses understanding key data concepts such as data quality, data sources, and basic statistical principles, as well as the ability to critically evaluate dashboards, reports, and visualizations. Business leaders with this skill can identify relevant metrics, spot trends and anomalies, and ask informed questions of data teams, ensuring that data-driven recommendations align with organizational goals and context. Practical Data Literacy also involves recognizing the limitations and potential biases in data, ensuring ethical use, and communicating findings effectively to diverse stakeholders. In today's business environment, where rapid decision-making and agility are paramount, this skill enables leaders to leverage data for competitive advantage, optimize operations, and drive innovation without requiring deep technical expertise. Typical use cases include evaluating sales performance dashboards, assessing customer behavior analytics, and making investment or resource allocation decisions based on data-driven evidence. By cultivating this skill, organizations can democratize data use, reduce reliance on technical gatekeepers, and accelerate informed, transparent decision-making at all levels.\n\nDomain: Business Strategy\nDomain Description: Strategic planning, market analysis, and business development\nSkill Type: Knowledge Based\nSkill Areas: Technical, Organizational\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
