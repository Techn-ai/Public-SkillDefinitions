  "description" : "Sustainable Technology Adoption is the technical skill of evaluating, selecting, and implementing new technologies within an organization while explicitly prioritizing environmental sustainability and resource efficiency. This skill requires a deep understanding of both current technological trends and sustainability frameworks, such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and ISO 14001. Practitioners must assess the environmental impact of hardware, software, and cloud solutions across their lifecycle, including energy consumption, e-waste generation, and supply chain sustainability. The skill involves integrating sustainability criteria into IT procurement, architecture design, and deployment processes, ensuring alignment with organizational environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. Key activities include conducting sustainability impact assessments, collaborating with vendors to ensure compliance with green standards, and leveraging tools for carbon footprint measurement and reporting. Change management and stakeholder engagement are critical, as successful adoption often requires cross-functional buy-in and user training. Immediate applications include migrating to energy-efficient data centers, adopting circular IT asset management practices, and implementing software solutions that optimize resource usage. Sustainable Technology Adoption is crucial today as organizations face increasing regulatory, reputational, and operational pressures to reduce their environmental footprint while maintaining technological competitiveness. It directly supports IT leaders in aligning digital transformation initiatives with sustainability objectives, ensuring that innovation does not come at the expense of planetary health.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
