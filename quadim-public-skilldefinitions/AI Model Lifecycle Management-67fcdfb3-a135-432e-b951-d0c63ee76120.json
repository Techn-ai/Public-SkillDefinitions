  "description" : "AI Model Lifecycle Management is the comprehensive practice of overseeing the end-to-end process of developing, deploying, maintaining, and retiring artificial intelligence (AI) models within an organization. This skill is critical in today’s technical landscape, where the reliability, compliance, and performance of AI models directly impact business outcomes and regulatory standing. Practitioners of AI Model Lifecycle Management are responsible for orchestrating all phases of the model lifecycle: from data acquisition, model design, and training, to validation, deployment, monitoring, and eventual decommissioning. Key activities include ensuring data quality and provenance, managing version control, tracking model lineage, and implementing robust testing and validation protocols to mitigate bias and ensure fairness. The skill also encompasses the integration of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) practices, enabling continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) of models, automated retraining, and real-time performance monitoring. Compliance with legal and ethical standards, such as GDPR or industry-specific regulations, is a core component, as is the documentation of model decisions for auditability and transparency. Immediate applications include managing production AI systems in sectors like finance, healthcare, and retail, where model drift, data privacy, and explainability are ongoing concerns. By mastering AI Model Lifecycle Management, technical professionals ensure that AI solutions remain robust, secure, and aligned with organizational goals, while enabling rapid adaptation to changing data and business requirements.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
