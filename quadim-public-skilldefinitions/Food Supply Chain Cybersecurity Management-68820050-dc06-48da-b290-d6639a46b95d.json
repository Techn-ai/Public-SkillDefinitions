  "description" : "Food Supply Chain Cybersecurity Management is the specialized technical discipline focused on safeguarding the digital assets, data, and operational technologies that underpin modern food supply chains. This skill involves the identification, assessment, and mitigation of cyber risks that threaten the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of systems managing food production, processing, distribution, and retail. Practitioners must understand the unique vulnerabilities present in interconnected supply chain networks, such as IoT-enabled logistics, automated warehousing, and supplier management platforms. The skill encompasses the implementation of robust security protocols, real-time monitoring, incident response, and compliance with industry-specific regulations like the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and relevant cybersecurity frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO/IEC 27001). Immediate applications include protecting sensitive supplier and customer data, preventing ransomware attacks that could disrupt food distribution, and ensuring the authenticity and traceability of food products through secure blockchain or traceability systems. This skill is currently critical due to the increasing frequency of targeted cyberattacks on food sector infrastructure, which can result in operational shutdowns, financial losses, and threats to public health. Effective Food Supply Chain Cybersecurity Management requires collaboration across IT, operations, and compliance teams, and is essential for maintaining consumer trust, regulatory compliance, and uninterrupted food availability in today's highly digitized and interconnected food industry.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
