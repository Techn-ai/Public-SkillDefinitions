  "description" : "Sustainable Digital Product Design is the technical discipline of creating digital products—such as websites, applications, and platforms—with a deliberate focus on minimizing environmental impact throughout their lifecycle. This skill integrates principles of eco-efficiency, responsible resource usage, and lifecycle assessment into the digital product development process. Practitioners apply methods such as energy-efficient coding, optimization of data storage and transfer, and selection of sustainable hosting solutions to reduce carbon emissions and resource consumption. The skill also involves evaluating the environmental footprint of user interactions, device compatibility, and backend infrastructure, ensuring that design decisions support both usability and sustainability. Key competencies include familiarity with tools for measuring digital carbon footprints (e.g., Website Carbon Calculator), knowledge of green software engineering practices, and adherence to standards such as the Sustainable Web Manifesto. Sustainable Digital Product Design is highly relevant today as organizations face increasing regulatory, consumer, and stakeholder pressure to demonstrate environmental responsibility. Typical use cases include optimizing media assets to reduce bandwidth, designing for device longevity, and implementing dark mode to lower energy use on OLED screens. The skill is essential for technical professionals aiming to align digital innovation with corporate sustainability goals, regulatory compliance, and the growing demand for environmentally conscious digital experiences.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
