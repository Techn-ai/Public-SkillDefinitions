  "description" : "Food Fraud Detection and Prevention is a critical technical skill focused on identifying, analyzing, and mitigating fraudulent activities within the food supply chain. This skill encompasses the application of scientific, analytical, and technological methods to detect intentional adulteration, mislabeling, counterfeiting, or substitution of food products for economic gain. Practitioners utilize advanced analytical chemistry techniques (such as mass spectrometry, DNA barcoding, and spectroscopy), data analytics, and supply chain monitoring tools to uncover anomalies and verify product authenticity. The skill also involves understanding regulatory frameworks (e.g., FSMA, EU Food Fraud Network), risk assessment methodologies, and the implementation of preventive controls and traceability systems. Food Fraud Detection and Prevention is immediately relevant today due to the increasing complexity of global food supply chains, rising consumer demand for transparency, and the significant economic and public health risks posed by fraudulent food products. Typical use cases include verifying the origin and purity of high-value ingredients (such as olive oil, honey, or seafood), detecting dilution or substitution in processed foods, and implementing anti-fraud protocols in food manufacturing and distribution. This skill is essential for food safety professionals, quality assurance specialists, and regulatory compliance officers, enabling organizations to protect brand integrity, ensure consumer safety, and comply with stringent food safety regulations.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250422-d9069681",
