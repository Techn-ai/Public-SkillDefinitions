  "description" : "AI Model Risk Management is the systematic process of identifying, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating risks associated with the development, deployment, and operation of artificial intelligence (AI) models. As organizations increasingly rely on AI for decision-making in critical and regulated sectors such as finance, healthcare, and insurance, the need for robust risk management practices has become paramount. This skill encompasses understanding and applying regulatory requirements (such as SR 11-7 in banking or the EU AI Act), implementing model governance frameworks, and ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability throughout the AI model lifecycle. Practitioners must be adept at evaluating model performance, detecting and mitigating bias, managing data quality risks, and ensuring explainability and auditability of AI systems. Key activities include conducting model validation and stress testing, establishing controls for model drift and data leakage, and maintaining thorough documentation for regulatory compliance. AI Model Risk Management also involves cross-functional collaboration with data scientists, compliance officers, IT security, and business stakeholders to align technical controls with organizational risk appetite and ethical standards. Immediate applications include risk assessments for credit scoring models, monitoring algorithmic trading systems, and ensuring compliance with privacy and anti-discrimination laws. Mastery of this skill is essential for safeguarding organizational reputation, ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining trust in AI-driven processes.\n\nDomain: General\nDomain Description: General skills that don't fit cleanly into other categories\nSkill Type: NotSet\nSkill Areas: Technical, Process\nRelevance Score: 1.2\nGenerated by: Frøya v2.0.0\nOperation ID: FR-20250423-315125e2",
